PRELIMINART DISSERTATION. 



In the extensive plan which is carried on 
under the direction of the great Governour 
of the Universe, an attentive observer will 
frequently perceive the most unexpected 
ends accomplished by means the most im- 
probable, and events branch putin to effects, 
which were neither foreseen, nor intended 
by the agents which produced them. A 
slight view of the consequences which have 
hitherto resulted from our intercourse with 
the East-Indies, will sufficiently evince the 
truth of this assertion. 

The thirst of conquest and the desire of 
gain, which first drew the attention ,of the 
most powerful and enlightened nations of 
Europe toward the fruitful regions of Hin- 



At 



Vlll 

dostan, have been the means of opening 
sources of knowledge and information to the 
I learned and the curious, and have added to 
I the stock of the literary world, treasures, 
I which, if not so substantial, are of a nature 
more permanent than those which have en- 
riched the commercial. 

The many elegant translations from the 
different Oriental languages, with which the 
world has been favoured within these last 
few^ years, have not failed to attract merited 
attention; and the curiosity awakened by 
these productions, concerning the people 
with whom they originated, has been gratifi- 
ed by the labours of men who have enjoyed 
the first rank in literary fame. 

Still, however, the writers in every branch 
of Oriental literature have to contend with 
disadvantages too numerous and too power- 
ful to be easily overcome. The names of 
the Heroes of Greece and Rome are render- 
ed familiar at a period of life when the mind 
receives every impression with facility, and 
tenaciously retains the impressions it re* 



ceiv^s. With the name of erery Hero the 
idea of hb character is associated, and the 
whole becomes afterwards so connected in 
the mind with the blissful period of life at 
wltich it was first received, that the recol- 
lected scenes of jovenile felicity may fre- 
i]pientlyv even in the most accomplished 
minds, be fonnd to give a lest to the charms 
of the ancient authors. To those who have 
not had the advantages of an early classical 
edncatiott, the same objections which render 
the translations from the Oriental writers 
tiresome and miinteresting, will operate with 
equal force on the most beautiful passages 
of Homer, or Vh^l ; and the names of Glau- 
cus and Sarpedon, of Anchises and Eneas, 
be found as hard to remember, and as diffi- 
cult to pronounce, as those of Krishna and 
Aijoun. 

Of these advantages, resulting from early 
prepossessions, the Persian and Hindoo wri- \ 
ters are entirely destitute, and the difficulty 
of reconciling the sounds of the names of 
their Heroes to an European ear is so great, 



that it is not til! after a greater degree of at- 
tention than the generality of readers will 
' bestow, that any appropriate idea of them 
f can be fixed in the mind. This appears to 
be at least one cause of that ignorance and 
apathetick indifference with regard to the 
affairs of the East, which is frequently to be 
remarked in minds that are in every other 
respect highly cultivated and accurately in- 
formed. For the sake of readers of this de- 
8cription> particularly those of my own sex, 
who may have been deterred by reasons 
above hinted at from seeking information 
from a more copious source, I think it neces- 
sary toward explaining many passages in 
the letters of the Rajah, which would other- 
wise have appeared utterly unintelligible, to 
give a short and simple sketch of the histo- 
ry of the nation to which they belonged. 
Should my feeble effort lead to further en- 
1 quiry; should it in the mind of any person 
: of taste give birth to a laudable curiosity 
upon a subject where so much is to be learn- 
ed, my design will be still more fully an- 



swered, and my wishes more completely 
fulfilled. 

That part of Asia known to Europeans 
by the name of Hindostan, extends from 4he 
mountains of Thibet on the I^orth to the 
sea on the South, and from the river Indus 
on the West to the Barampooter .on the 
iEast, comprehending within its limits a va- 
riety of provinces, many of which have 
been famous, from the earliest ages, for the 
salubrity of their climate, the richness of 
their productions, and the fertility of their 
soil. Of this country, the Hindoos* are the 

* The word Hind, from whence Hindoo^ aod Hindos- 
tan, or coantrj of the Hindoos, is of Persian origin, com- 
puted by Colonel Dow to have been derived from Hind, a 
suppotod son of Ham, the son of Noah } and by other 
Orientalists, to owe its origin to the river Indus. For the 
sake of such as take pleasure in tracing etymologies, I in- 
aert a note written on the margin of the copy of Oentoo 
Laws, now in my possession, by one whose knowledge of 
the Persian language has not been excelllied by any. He 
says, * The word Hind is often osed by the Persian Poets 
to signify Black or dark-colaurtd^ and it is probable that 
Hindoi may mean no more than a hUdi fMn, as our negro 
from NigvtJ* 



Aborigines. Over Um origin of this cele* 
brated people. Time has cast the impenetra* 
ble mantle of oblivion. Their own annals 
trace it back to a period so remote, so far 
beyond the date of European Chronology, 
as to be rejected by European pride. The 
magnificent proofs of ancient grandeur, how- 
ever, which are still to be found, and which 
have been sought for with the most success* 
ful assiduity by many of our countrymen in 
India, give the most irrefragable testimony 
of the antiquity of their empire, and seem 
to confirm the assertion of its Historians, 
* that its duration is not to be paralelled by 
the history of any other portion of the human 
race.' To account for this extraordinary 
degree of permanency, we must direct our 
attention, not to the barriers formed by na- 
ture around their territories, but to those 
internal causes arising from the nature of 
their Oavemment^ their Laws^ ReUgian^ mo- 
red Prejudices^ and established rn^^^zh. 

The ancient government, t». oughout 
Hindostan, appears to have been a federa* 
tive union of the various states, each go- 



▼erned by its own Rajah, or Chief, but sub- 
jected, in a sort of feudal vassalage, to the 
sovereignty of the supreme Emperour, who 
was head of the whole. 
. The manner in which the Rayahs of the 
Hindoos exercised the rights of dominion 
over their people, bears so little analogy to 
that practised by the i>etty sovereigns of 
such European states as are placed in cir- 
cnmstances nearly similar, that it would be 
doing the greatest Injustice to the amiable 
and benevolent character of the Hindoos, to 
bring them into comparison. There the 
right of sovereignty bore the mild aspect of 
parental authority. The Prince considered 
the people in the light of children, whom he 
was appointed by Heaven to protect and 
cherish; and the affection of the subject 
for the Prince, under whose auspices he en- 
joyed the blessings of freedom and tranquilli- 
ty, was heightened by esteem for his virtues 
Into the most inviolable attachment*

in to justify and illustrate the assertions of the Historian.

ed in the followiog passage of the Bbagrat 
Geeta, an episode, from their great epick 
poem, translated into English by Mr. Wil« 
kins. 

*' The natural duty of the Bramin is 
peace, self-restraint, patience, rectitude, wis- 
dom, and learning. The natural duties of 
the Khettrie, are bravery, glory, not to flee 
from the field; rectitude, generosity, and 
princely conduct. The tfbtural duties of 
the Bice are to cultivate the land, to tend 
the cattle, and to buy and sell. The natu- 
ral duties of the Sooder is servitude ; a maa 
by following the duties appointed by his 
birth, ciinnot do wrong. A man being con- 
tented with his arm particular situation obtam- 
eth peffeetianJ* 

Though all Bramins are not Priests, 
none but such as are of this Cast can per- 
form any offices of the priestly function. 
The members of every other Cast preserve 
for theirs the most respectful veneration, 
and a spirit of partiality toward them seems 



XVII 

to breathe throughout their laws, as well as 
religious institutions. 

Those who take pleasure in pointing the 
shafts of sarcasm against the order of the 
Priesthood (without considering that invec- 
tives against any society of individuals are 
only satires upon human nature) will readi- 
ly assign to the Bramins themselves, the 
formation of laws which appear so favoura- 
ble to their interests, and produce it^as an 
additional proof of priestly cunning and am- 
bition; but a moment's reflection on the 
duties, as well as privileges, of this Cast, 
will put an end to invidious exultation. 

An abhorrence of the shedding of hlood, 
18 a principle which pervades the whole of 
the Hindoo religion, but the Bramins ob- 
serve it in the strictest degree. They eat 
nothing that has life in it : their food con- 
sisting entirely of fruit and vegetables ; 
their only luxury being the milk of the 
Cow, an animal for, whose species they 
have a particular veneration. Not only 
every act of hostility, but even every me-

thod of defence is, to fbem, strictly prohi- 
bited; submittiDg to violence with unresist* 
ing patience and humility, they leave it to 
God, and their Rajahs, to avenge whatever ' 
injuries they may sustain. 

The separation of the different Casts 
from each other is absolute and irreversi- 
ble; it forms the fundamental principle of 
their laws, and the slightest breach of it 
never fails to incur universal reprobation. 

Thus those sources of disquiet, which 
have held most of the empires of the earth 
in a -state of perpetual agitation, were un- 
known to the peaceful children of Brahma. 
The turbulence of ambition, the emula- 
tions of envy, and the murmurs of discon- 
tent, were equally unknown to a people, 
where each individual, following the occu- 
pation, and walking in the steps of his fa^' 
thers, considered it as his primary duty to 
keep in the situation that he firmly believed 
to have been marked out for him by the 
hand of Providence. 



XIX 

In the spiril of the religion of the Hin- 
doos, a still more efficient cause of the dnra- 
bility of their state presents itself to our 
view. Original in its nature, and absolute 
in its decrees, its precepts induce a total 
seclusion from the rest of mankind. Far, 
however, from disturbing those who are of a 
different faith, by endeavours to convert 
them, it does not even admit of proseljtes 
to its own. Though tenacious of their 
own doctrines in k degree that is unexam^ 
pled in the history of any other religion, 
the most fervent zeal in the most pious Hin- 
doos leads them neither to hate, nor despise^ 
nor pity such as are of a different belief, nor 
does it suffer them to consider others as 
less favoured by the Almighty than them- 
selves. This spirit of unbounded toleration 
proceeded in a natural course from the sub- 
lime and exalted notions of the Deity, taught 
by the Bramins and every where to be met 
with in their writings, and which are only 
equalled in that Gospel * which brought 
life and immortality to ligbt.^ 



nx 

That Being vrhom they distinguish by 
the different . appellations of the Principle 
of Truth ! the Spirit of AViadom ! the Su- 
preme ! by whom the Universe was spread 
abroad, whose perfections none can grasp 
within the limited circle of human ideas, 
views, they say, with equal complacency, 
all who are studious to perform his will 
throughout the immense family of creation. 
They deem it derogatory to the character 
of this Being, to say that he prefers one re- 
ligion to another, * to suppose such prefe- 
rence being the height of impiety, as it 
would be supposing injustice toward those 
whom he left ignorant of his will :' and they 
therefore conclude that every religion is 
peculiarly adapted to the country and peo- 
ple where it is practised.^ The Bramins, 
who compiled the Code of Gentoo Laws, 
translated by Mr. Halhed, explain their 
opinion upon this subject in very explicit 
terms : ' the truly intelligent (say they) well 
know, that the differences and varieties of 

- — • See Crawford'! Sketches. 



XXI 

created things are a ray of his glorious es- 
sence, and that the contrarieties of constitu- 
tions are types of his wonderful attributes. 
He appointed to each Tribe its own faith, 
and to every Sect its own religion, and 
views, in each particular place, the mode of 
worship respectively appointed it. Some- 
times he is employed, with the attendants 
upon the Mosque, in counting the sacred 
beads; sometimes he is in the Temple at 
the adoration of idols, the intimate of the 
Mussulman, and the friend of the Hindoo, 
the companion of the Christian, and the 
confidant of the Jew.' 

A toleration founded npon such systema- 
tick principles, would necessarily exclude 
tbose argumentative disputations, those cruel 
and obstinate animosities, which, alas t un- 
der a dispensation whose very essence is 
benevolence, have so often disturbed the 
peace of society. There the acrimonious 
censure, the keen retort, the vehement in- 
vective against those who differed in opi- 
nion, was totally unknown. Under the 



zxit 

banners of their religion, (he irascible pas- 
sions were never ranged. * He, my ser- 
vant,* says Krishna, Speaking in the person 
of the Deity, * He, my servant, is dear to 
me, who h free fram enmUy, merciiul, and 
exempt from pride and seieshness, and who 
is the same in pain and in pleasure, patient 
of wrongs, contented, and whose mind is 
fixed on me alone.' 

I shall conclude this account of the no- 
tions of the Deity entertained by the Hin- 
doos, with the first stanza of that beautiful 
Hymn to Narrayina, or the Spirit of God 
exerted in Creation, translated by the ele- 
gant pen of Sir William Jones. 

* Spirit of Spirits ! who, through every part 

Of space eipanded and of eiidtess time. 

Beyond the stretch of labVing thought sablime, 

Bad'st uproar into beauteous order start, 

Before Heaven was, Thou art : 

Ere spheres beneath us rolPd or spheres above. 

Ere Earth in firmamental ether hung, 

Thou 8at*st alone, till through thy mystick love 

Things uoeiisting to existence sprung, 

And grateful descant sung. 

What first impcU'd Thee to exert thy might ?

Ooodaeis UDlimited.— What glorious light 

Thy powers directed ? Wiadoin without bound. 

What provM it first ? Oh ! guide my faocy right. 

Oh ! raise from cumb*rou8 ground 

My soul, in rapture drown'd, 

That fearless it may soar on wings of fire ; 

For Thou, who only knowst, Thou only can'st inspire.*' 

A further view of their religious syslem 
may be necessary, and will, perhaps be 
sufficient to elucidate another characteristick 
feature of the Hindoos, which has forcibly 
struck all who have had an opportunity of 
observing them. The patience evinced by 
this mild and gentle race under the seve- 
rest suffering, and the indifference with 
which they view the approach of death, 
which has been severally assigned to consti- 
tutiodal apathy, to their mode of living, and 
to the delicate texture of their bodies, may 
perhaps be equally accounted for from their 
firm and stedfast belief in a future state. 
This belief, indeed, is darkened by many 
errours. They believe that the human soul 
 ed by suffering, and that it is 
not till after having^ undergone this expia- 



xxiv 

tory diBcipline through a series of different 
f bodies, that it becomes worthy of admissioa 
/ to eternal happiness. The evil inflicted 
upon the seemingly inoffensive, is attributed 
by them as a punishment for crimes com- 
mitted in a pre-existent state. Revolting 
from the idea of eternal punishment, as in- 
compatible with the justice and goodness of 
their Creator, they believe that the souls of 
the wicked, after having been for a time 
confined I in Narekha (the infernal regions) 
are sent back upon the stage of life, to ani- 
mate the bodies of the inferiour creation, 
till by various chastisements and transmir 
grations in these probationary states, every 
vicious inclination is sufficiently corrected 
to admit of their reception into the regions 
of perfection and happiness. 'Animated 
by the desire of obtaining that final boon,* 
says a late Historian,^  and fired by all th« 
glorious promises of their religion, the pa- 
tient Hindoo smiles amid unutterable mise-

rjr, and exults in erery dire variety of volun- 
tary torture.' 

Notwithstanding the sublime notions of 
the Hindoo concerning Deity, and notwith- 
standing the strenuoiB assertions of the best 
informed Bramins even at the present day, 
that their worship is only directed to one 
divine essence, and that the many inferiour 
deities, whose images till their temples, are 
but so many emblems of his different attri- 
butes, it must be confessed, that the religion 
of the vulgar has degenerated into the gross- 
est idolatry. This may be accounted for by 
the jealous, care with which the tribe of 
Brahma prevented the intrusion of the multi- 
tude into those avenues to science and to 
truth, of which they were the peculiar guardi- 
ans.* Ignorance naturally leads to super- 
stition, and, the vulgar of all ranks, fixing 
their attention on the external object that is 
presented to them, lose sight of the more re- 
mote and spiritual allusion, and soon transfer 
that veneration to the symbol, which was at

first meant odIj to be excited for the thing 
signified. Nor is it in the religioD of Hin- 
dostan alone, that similar effects are produc- 
ed by causes of a like nature. 

To enter upon the disquisition of a subject 
so extensive and so intricate as that of Hin- 
doo Mythology, would he to wander far from 
the purpose of the present Introduction: 
such an idea of it, however, as may serve to 
elucidate some passages in the Letters of the 
Rijah, which allude to their divinities, may 
be deemed neither unnecessary nor imperti- 
nent. 

The first thing that presents itself to our 
view is the Triad of Deity, Brimha, Veesh- 
na, and Seeva, under which form is repre- 
sented the three great attributes of the AI- 
mif^hty — Power to create. Goodness to pre- 
serve, and Justice to punbh. The long list 
of the inferiour Deities, which follow, exhi- 
bit snch a striking similitude in their charac- 
ter and offices to the ancient Gods of Greece 
and Rome, that it has led to a conjecture of 
their being actually the same, and an attempt 



xxvu 

has been made by a writer of equal taste and 
erudition, to prove their identity, and to 
traee their wanderings thr^ugh the mazes of 
Grecian and Egyptian lore. Of the mem- 
bers of this numerous Pantheon, it will be 
sufficient for our purpose to mention the few 
following. 

The first in rank is Ganesa, the God of 
Wisdom, who is thought to be the Janus of 
the Grecian Mythology ; Carticeya, the God 
of War, whose prowess is not inferiour to 
tliat of the Mars of Rome. Seraswattee, the 
Goddess of Letters, and Protectress of Arts 
and Sciences, whose ins'gnia, the Palmyra 
Leaf and the Reed or Pen (implements used 
in writing) are surely more appropriate to 
her character than the Shield and Lance, 
which graced the Minerva of the Greeks. 
Cama, or the God of Love, is said, by Sir 
William Jones, to be the twin brother of the 
Grecian Cupid, with richer and more lively 
appendages. And, indeed, if we form our 
notions of this fabulous divinity from the 
beautiful Ode addressed to him by an ancient 



xxviii 

Hindoo bard, we must confess his saperiority 
to be very evident.* And, lastly Surraya, 
or the Ood of Day, who, in his chariot, 
drawn by seven green horses, bears so near

preservation of their empire in happiness 
and tranquillity, were not so favourable to 
the cultivation of the mind, and to its ad- 
vancement in the paths of useful knowledge. 
' To expand the faculties of the human 
soul the passions must be called into action, 
nor can any of these be laid under such re- 
straint as dooms them to lie for ever dor- 
mant, without injuring the powers of the

In the struggle of contending interests, 
though peace is sometimes lost, intellectual 
energy is roused, and while the strife of 
emulation and the restlessness of ambition 
disturb the quiet of society, they produce, in 
their collision, the genius that adorns it : 
it is accordingly pronounced, by one who 
must be allowed competent to the decision, 
that ' Reason and Taste are the grand pre- 
rogatives of European minds, while the

But notwithstanding all the disadvantages 
under which they laboured, the many monu- 
ments that yet remain of th^ir former splen- 
dour, the specimens of their literature, and 
the productions of their manufactures, suffi- 
ciently evince their advancement in the 
sciences which dignify life, as well as in 
the arts that ornament it. 

The Bramins, to whom the cultivation 
of science was exclusively committed, seem 
to have made no contemptible use of their 
high privilege. In astronomy they are al- 
lowed to have excelled; many works of 
their ancient writers on metapJbysicks, and 
ethicks, have already come to our know- 
ledge; and, surely, no lover of poetry can 
peruse the specimens of that divine art, 
which have been presented to the publick in 
an Kogiish dress, without feeling a desire to 
be more intimately acquainted with the pro- 
ductions of the Hindoo bards. 

The degree of knowledge we already 
possess concerning the antiquities of Hin- 
dostan, [has not been attained without ef-

the spirit of literary curiosity ? When sup- 
ported by philosophy, and guided by taste, 
it seldom fails to subdue every difficulty, 
and to see its persevering labours crowned 
with success ! 

How much this observation has been ve^ 
rified in respect to the Asiatick Society, 
is well known to all who have perused the 
volumes of their Researches. It is thus 
briefly described by Mr. Maurice, in the 
Introduction to his Indian Antiquities. * The 
buried tablet has been dug from the bowels 
of the earth ; the fallen and mouldering pillar 
has been reared; coins and medals, struck 
in commemoration of grand and important 
events, have been recovered from the se- 
pulchral darkness of two thousand years; 
and the obsolete characters, engraved on 
their superficies, have, with immense toil, 
been decyphered and explained.' 

In the contemplation of these scientifick 
labours, the Governour General, under 



XXXV 

vrhose auspices they were commenced) will 
have the deserved meed of grateful acknow- 
ledgment from every candid and philoso- 
phick mind ; for although he declined com- 
plying with the wishes of the members, who 
were all solicitous to see him at the head of 
their society, he was eminently instrumental 
in promoting its success ; and in this, as in 
every other instance, he stood forth the 
steady friend, the liberal patron, and zealous 
promoter of useful knowledge. 

How much the world has been indebted 
to the learned Gentleman who was nomi- 
nated to the Presidentship of the Society, 
is too well known tu require animadversion. 
Long and deeply will his loss be deplor- 
ed by every lover of literature and friend 
to virtue.

hearts of many, cailiog forth the tear of 
tender recollection, and of unextinguished^ 
though, alas ! unavailing sorrow. 

The reader of sensibility will, it is hoped, 
pardon a digression into which the writer 
has heen betrayed by feelings of which they 
know the power and influence, and from 
which she hastily returns, to remark that the 
happiness enjoyed by the Hindoos under 
the mild and auspicious government of their 
native Princes, and preserved, without any 
material interruption, through such a mighty 
period of revolving time as staggers the be- 
lief of the ever-fluctuatiog nations of Eu- 
rope, was at length doomed to see its over- 
throw effected by the resistless fury of Fana- 
tick zeal. 

The impostor of Mecca had established 
as one of the principles of his doctrine, the 
necessity of extendiug it, either by persua- 
sion or the sword, to ail parts uf the earth. 
How steadily this injunction was adhered 
to by his followers, and with what success it

was pursued, is well known to all who are la 
the least conversant in history. 

The same overwhelming torrent which 
had inundated the greater part of Africa, 
burst its way into the very heart of Europe, 
and covered many kingdoms of Asia with 
unbounded desolation, directed its baleful 
course to the flourishing provinces of Hin- 
dostan. Here these fierce and hardy ad* 
venturers, whose only improvement had 
been in the science of destruction, who ad- 
ded the fury of fanaticism to the ravages of 
war, found the great end of their conquests 
opposed by obstacles, which neither the ar- 
dour of their persevering zeal, nor savage 
barbarity could surmount. Multitudes were 
sacrificed by the cruel hand of religious per- 
secution, and whole countries were deluged 
;in blood, in the vain hope, that by the des- 
* traction of a part, the remainder might be 
persuaded or terrified into the profession of 
Mahomedanism : but all these sanguinary 
efforts were ineffectual ; and at length, being 
fully convinced, that though they might ex-

tirpate, tbey could never hop^ to convert 
any number of the Hindoo3, tbey relinquisli- 
ed the impracticable jdea with which they 
had entered upon their career of conquest, 
and contented themBelves with the acquire- 
ment of the civil dominion and almost uni« 
versal empire of Hindostan. 

In these provinces^ where the Mussulman 
jurisdiction was fully established, Mussul- 
man courts of justice were erected. The 
laws which the Hindoos had for numberless 
ages been accustomed to revere, as of di- 
vine authority, were set aside, and all cau- 
ses judged and decided by the standard of 
Mussulman jurisprudence; an evil which 
appeared to the unhappy Hindoo more for- 
midable than the extortions of avarice, or 
the devastations of cruelty.^ Nor was the 
effect of these latter passions unfelt ; the pe- 
culiar punishment of forfeiting their Ca8t> 
which is attached by their law to the most 
temporary and seemingly trivial deviation

from its precepts, and which involves in it 
the dreadful consequences of irremediable 
alienation and irreversible proscription was 
converted by their Mahomedan rulers into ft 
lucrative source of oppression. Superatition 
combined with avarice to invent the means 
of inflicting this dreadful chastisement, and 
fines, without mercy, were exacted by those 
bigotted and venal judges. 

By the same merciless conquerors, their 
commerce was impeded by every clog which 
avaricious and unfeeling power could invent 
to obstruct it. Neither the mild and tolerat- 
ittg spirit of the religion of the Hindoos, nor 
the gentle and inoffensive manners of its 
Totaries, were sufficient to protect tbetil 
from the intolerant zeal and brutal antipathy 
of their Mahomedan invaders. In the 
effusions of their barbarous enthusiasm, the 
temples of the Hindoos, ornamented with 
the most curious sculpture and decorated 
with all the ingenuity and skill for which 
they were celebrated, were utterly demolish- 
ed, and the monuments of their ancient 
splendour every where destroyed* 



x\l 

For the support of the Mogul Nobles, 
asfligoments ^ere granted on the lands of 
the different provinces, Tirhich were levied 
by these military lords in person, who, 
haughty and voluptuous, came to collect 
their pay from a timid people, whom they 
hated and despised with all the fervour of 
bigotry and ignorance. 

To enumerate the multifarious load of op- 
pression under which the unhappy Hindoos 
Were doomed to groan, would be a tedious 
lind ungrateful task. A generous mind can- 
not take pleasure in contemplating the pic- 
ture of human misery and human crime, 
though drawn by the correct hand of truth : 
let it then suffiee to say, that the whole sys- 
tem of Mogul government toward their con- 
quered Provinces, was such as could never 
fail to shock an European mind. 

Hard, however, as was the fate of the poor 
Hindoos under their Mogul Sovereigns, even 
in the most flourishing state of their empire; 
when that Empire mouldered to decay, and 
the power of one despot was overthrown to 



xlU 

make way for the^uncontrolled licentiousness 
of numberless petty tyrants, it became yet 
more truly deplorable.^ 

The vigourous administration of a long 
line of able Princes, had alone for ages pre- 
served this vast but heterogeneous and ill- 
constructed fabrick from dissolution; and 
when, according to the unavoidable conse- 
jqnences of hereditary despotism, the reins 
of government were transmitted into weak 
and feeble hands, it fell rapidly to ruin. To 
the wretched successor of the Imperial 
throne, the miserable representative of the 
house of Timur, little now remains but an 
universally acknowledged title to royalty, 
declared by inefficacious expressions of 
loyalty and attachment ; while those who, 
by bold usurpation, successful rebellion, or 
insidious fraud, possessed themselves of the 
spoils of the ruined empire, have established 
in their own families the right of succession 
to the territories thus acquired. 

* SeeRohiUaHittoiy. 



xliii 

In those proyioces which, by a Irain of 
circumstances totally foreign to our purpose 
, to relate, have fallen under the dominion of 
Great Britain, it is to be hoped the long* 
suffering Hindoos have experienced a happy 
change. Nor can we doubt of this, when 
Vfe consider, that in those provinces the 
horrid modes of punishment inflicted by the 
Mahomedans have been abolished; the 
fetters which restrained their commerce 
have been taken off; the taxes are no longer 
collected by the arbitrary authority of a mili- 
tary chieftain, but are put upon a footing 
that at once secures the revenue and pro* 
tects the subject from oppression. The 
Banditti of the Hills, whkh used to molest 
the inoffensive inhabitants by their predato- 
ry incursions, have been brought into peace- 
able subjection. That unrelenting persecu- 
tion, which was deemed a duty by the igno- 
ant bigotry of their Mussulman rulers, has, 
by the milder spirit of Christianity, been 
converted into the tenderest indnlgencies. 
Their ancient laws have been restored to 



xliv 

then; a translation of them into the Fenian 
and English languages has been made, and is 
BOW the guide of the Courts of Justice which 
have been established among them. Agri- 
culture lias been encouraged by the most 
certain of all methods — the security of pro- 
perty ; and all these advantages have been 
rendered doubly valuable, by the enjoyment 
of a bleuing equal, if not superiour, to every 
other — the Blessing of Peace, a blessing to 
which they had for ages been strangers."" 

These salutary regulations, originating 
with Mr. Hastings, steadily , pursued by 
8ir John MTherson and Lord Cornwallis, 
and persevered in by the present Governour 
General, will diffuse the smiles of prospe- 
rity and happiness over the best provinces 
of Hindostan long after the discordant 
voice of Party shall have been humbled in 
the silence of eternal rest ; and the ranco- 
rous misrepresentations of envy and male- 
volence, as much forgotten as the florid 
harangues and turgid declamations which 

* Review of tike Britiifa GoTenmieDt in lodia. 



conveyed them to the short-lived notice of 
the world. 

The chaoge which has been effected on 
the character and manners of the Hindoos 
during so maoj years of subjection and sq 
many convulsions in their political state, is 
not by any means so great as such power- 
foi causes might have been supposed to havo 
produced. 

In wandering through the desolated islands 
of the Archipelago, or even on the clasaick 
shores of Italy, the enlightened traveller 
ffould in vain hope to recognise, in the pre* 
sent inhabitants, one remaining lineament 
of the distinguishing characteristicks of their 
illustrioos ancestors. There the mouldering 
edifice, the fallen plUar, and the broken 
arch, bear, alone^ their silent testimony to 
the genius and refinement of the states 
which produced them. But in fiindostan, 
the original features (hat marked the charac- 
ter of their nation, from time Immemorial, are 
still too visible to be mistaken or overlook- 
ed. Though they have, nodoobt, loslmucb

mannera, those religious pfvjudices which 
kept them in a stale of perpetual separation 
fyrom their conquerors, haft^tended to the 
preservation or their originality of cliaracter 
And all its correspondent virtues. 

In the few districts which, secured by 
their insignificancy or the inaccessibility oi 
their situation, retained their independence, 
the original character still remains apparent 
Such, till aboat the middle of the present 
century, Was the fate of those whose ter- 
ritories were situate along the mountains of 
Kummaoom. 

The inhabitants of this lofty boundary of 
the rich and fertile province of Kuttalier 
continued to enjoy the blessings of indepen- 
dence and security, till that province was 
brought under the sutgection of a bold and 
successful Rohilla adventurer, who establish* 
ing himself and his followers in the pos- 
session of Knttaher (which from thenceforth 
lN>re the name of Robilcund) directed his 
arms toward the extirpation of those Rigahs

irhose yieinity excited his jealousy and 
alarmed his pride. 

He succeeded but too well in the execu« 
lion of his uajust design, and did not fail 
to make the most tyrannical use of the vic- 
tory he had obtained. Some of these Chiefs 
lie banished for ever from the long enjoyed 
seats of their ancestors ; some he removed 
to the other side of the Ganges, and from 
the few he suffered to remain, he stipulated 
the payment of an annual tribute^ and the 
immediate deposit of an exorbitant fine. 

The Riyah Zaarmilla, who will soon be 
introduced to the acquaintance of the reader, 
Itppears to have been descended from one of 
those petty Sovereigns who were obliged to 
put on the galling yoke of their unfeeling 
conqueror. He, however, must be supposed 
to have been among the number who were 
permitted to remain on their ancient terri- 
tories, while the family of his friend and 
correspondent Maandaara appears to have

been banished from the Province, and to 
have taken shelter in the neighbourhood 

of Agra. 

This short sketch, imperfect as it is, maj 
serve to give some idea of the state of Hin- 
dostan, not only when the letters of the 
Rajah, which are now to be laid before the 
publick, were written, but antecedent to 
that period. Adequate, however, to the 
purpose of elucidation, as it may be thought 
by some readers, it may be censured by 
others, as a presumptuous effort to wander 
out of that narrow and contracted path which 
they have allotted to the female mind- 
To obviate this objection, the writer 
hopes it will be sufficient to give a succinct 
account of the motives which led her to the 
examination of a subject at one time very 

^ universally talked of, but not often very 
thoroughly understood. From her earliest 
instructors she imbibed the idea, that toward 

■ a strict performance of the several duties of 
life, Ignorance was neither a necessary nor a 
useful auxiliary, but on the contraiy, that she 



xlix 

ough^ to view every new idea as an acquisi- 
tion, and to seize, with avidity, every proper v 
opportunity for mailing the acquirement. 

In the retirement of a country life, it was 
from books alone that any degree of informa- 
tion was to be obtained ; but when these « 
sequestered scenes where exchanged for the 
metropolis, opportunities for instruction, of a 
nature still more pleasing, were presented. 
The afiEairs connected with the state of our 
dominions in India were then the general 
topick of conversation. It was agreeable, 
from its novelty ; and she had the peculiar 
advantage of hearing it discussed by those 
who, from local knowledge, accurate infor- . 
nation, and unbiassed judgment, were emi- 
nently qualified to render the discussion both 
interesting and instructive. The names of 
the most celebrated Orientalists became fa- 
miliar to her ear ; a taste for the productions ' 
of their writers was acquired ; and, had it 
not l)een for a fatal event, which transform^^' 
ed the cheerful haunt of domestick happi- 
ness into the gloomy abode of sorrow, and

changed the ene^y of Hope into the Kltleti* 
sess of degpoRdency^ a coiiipeteDt know-* 
.ledge of the language of the originals would 
likewise have been acquired. Tioie» at 
length, poured its balm into the wounds of 
affliction, and the mind, by degrees, took 
pleasure in reverting to subjects which were 
interwoven with the ideas of past felicity. 
The letters of the Rajah were sought for, 
and the employment they afforded was found 
so salutary in beguiling the hours of solitude 
and soothing the pain of thought, that the 
study of them was resumed as an useful re- 
laxation, and, being brought to a conclusion* 
they are now presented to the world, whose 
decision upon their merit is looked forward to 
with timid hope and determined resignation. 



IT hai beeD justly ponplaipedt ^t the di£Rerent orthog- 
raphy adopted by the Orieotal traoshiton is a source

the variety of opinions that prevail upon the subject, 
it is an evil which cannot easily be remedied. Instead 
of the double rowels ee and oo, used by Mr. Wilkins, 
and liieuently by Mr. Halhed, Sir William Jones 
substitutes t and « ; and instead of the K, made use 
of by the former gentleman, he uses the letter C. 
From the diflbrent modes of pronunciation among the 
natives in thediiferent provinces, another difficulty 
has arisen. It is from that cause that we frequently 
find the letter B a substitute for F, as Beena for 
Veena, and c.

of wrath which have been eng:endpred by- 
mistake, and poured forth in the whirlwind 
of impetuosity. 

I might justly expostulate upon the harsh- 
ness of thy expressions; but I call to mind 
the goodness of thy heart, and they are ef- 
faced from my memory. We shrin)( from the 
fury of the King of Rivers, when his terrour- 
striliing voice threatens destruction to the 
surrounding world; but when his silver waves 
return to the peaceful channel allotted to 
them by the adored Veeshnii, we forget our 
terrours, and contemplate with rapture the 
myestick grandeur of the sacred stream who 
rolls his blessings to a thousand nations. 
And who would not prefer the casual fury of 
the mighty Ganges, to the apathetick dull" 
nesB of the never moving pool ? 

The Angel of Truth, whose dwelling is 
with Brahma, he my witness, that I have 
never been unmindful of the vo^ s of friend- 
ship we so solf mnly exchanged over the still 
warm ashes of , the venerable Puudit, who

was the gaide and the instructor of our ten- 
der jears. Twice, in performance of that 
vow, bave I essayed to send the promised in- 
formation, and twice have my intentions 
been frustrated. 

No sooner had the auspicious arms of 
the sons of mercy opened the long-obstructed 
channels uf conveyance and checked the 
fury of the Afghan Khans, who have so long 
oppressed our unhappy country,^ than I 
dispatched a messenger to thee, with a full 
account of publick affairs, and of all the in- 
cidents that have occurred to me in my re- 

* * Oo the 22d day of April, 1774, was fought between 
the armies of the ?i8i«r, arsbted by the Eoglith, and the

battle of Cutterah ; in which the complete victory obtain- 
ed by the former at ouce aoDihilated the power aod decid- 
ed the fate of the Afghan adveoturers. Wherever the fate 
of the Rohillas became known (says the historian of their 
short lived empire) the Hindoo Zimeendars (each of whom 
is possessed of a strong hold attaching to the chief village 
of his district) shut their forts, and refusing to their late 
masters protection, plundered without distinction all whom 
they found flying toward the hills.'* 



tirement Two months ago I learned that 
this messenger was drowned in bis attempts 
to pHBs the Jumna. Again I wrote the same 
voluminous detail, and sent it by the hands 
of a Hircarrah, employed in the English 
camp, and who was- sent by them with dis- 
patches to Agra, his native city. This 
messenger, more unfortunate than the other, 
was seked and cut in pieces by a band of 
brutal Afghans. Hoping that this account 
will fully ei^culpate me from the charge of 
neglect, and leaving it to the shrill voice of 
fame to acquaint thee with the publick 
transactions of this eventful perio4> 1 shall 
recapitulate such parts of my two epistles as

the promises that hbve passed between us,

me, by all that we had suffered from the 
cruelty of Allee Mohamed and the tyranny

back upon the swords of their enemies. I 
returned for answer, that ^ I gave praise to 
Veeshnd, who had avenged the wrongs of

to lift my hand against a fallen foe.' I then 
issued strict orders to all imy Ryots to keep

to rest. Reflections upon the vicissitudes of 
fortune agitated my soul. Sleep forsook my

other beasts of pirey» who had been disturbed 
in their deos, the crackling of the flames, 
and the bright glare of the still-spreading 
fire, formed altogether ao unspeakable com- 
bination of horrours. 

Many of the wretched fugitives passed the 
place where I stood; no longer the proud 
and haughty lords, at whose frown the Ra- 
jahs of the earth were wont to tremble : ter- 
rour now sat upon their humbled foreheads, 
and despair seemed the leader of their steps. 
While I contemplated their present calami- 
ty, the remembrance of their former tyranny 
passed into the bosom of oblivien. A young 
man appeared, the blood still streaming from 
his wounds while on his back he bore his 
aged father In vain did the old man entreat 
this dutiful son to leave him to his fate ; he 
still proceeded, with tottering steps, to con- 
vey him he knew not whither. . * Surely,' 
said I, ' the actions of this old man must 
have been meritorious in the sight of Heaven, 
that he should have been rewarded with such 



8 

a flon.' I looked on the old wftirioar, and 
called to mind the grey hairs of my father. 

I stopped the fugitives, ifrho seeing my 
dress, looked on me without hope, and pre- 
pared themselves to receive the stroke of 
death. Whatever are your offences, said I 
to the son, your filial piety has in my eyes 
made atonement : turn, therefore, to the shel« 
ter of my fortress, where you may remain in 
safety till times of peace. They expressed 
their thankfulness, and with them I returned 
to my house. At the foot of the hill I heard 
a groan, which I perceived to proceed from 
under the branches of a tree that had lately 
fallen. I ordered my servants to search for 
the person who uttered it, and to my asto- 
nishment saw one in the dress of an English 
officer ; he appeared to suffer the anguish of 
excessive pain, and though borne by the ser- 
vants with all possible care, before we could 
reach the house the invisible spirit seemed 
about to forsake the noble dwelling that had 
been allotted to it. On examination we 
found that his leg and many of bis ribs ware 



9 



fractured. While I was in despair about this 
appareotlj irremediable misfortune, the old 
Afghan addressed himself to me, and profess- 
ine; his skill in the art of surgery, told me 
that he thought he could effect a cure. He 
accordingly applied such remedies as he 
deemed proper, and with such success that 
the stranger soon obtained some degree of 
relief. He no sooner lifted his eyes upon 
me, than calling to mind the English that 
had been taught us, by the Vaidya Beass, I 
held out to him the hand of friendship, say- 
ing,  how do ?' His eyes glistened with 
pleasure, and from that moment our hearts 
were united by the seal of friendship. When 
the tyrant pain had a little loosened the 
fetters of her power, he spoke to me in the 
Persian language ; of which, as well as the 
Arabick and the different dialects of Hindos- 
tan, he was perfect mnsier. His conversation 
was like the soft dew of the morning, when 
it falls upon the valley of roses ; it at once 
refreshed and purified the soul. His know- 
ledge, in comparison of that of the most 



1% 

learaed amoog the Pundits of the present 
age, was like the moantains of Gommow 
compared to the nest of the ant. The pow- 
ers of his mind were deep and extensive as 
the wave of the mighty Ganges. His heart 
was the seat of virtuey and truth reposed in 
hb bosom. 

He had set out many months before, from 
Calcntta» with an intention of travelling 
through the northern parts of Hindostan^ in 
order to trace the antiquities of (he nnist an- 
cient of nations. He had proceeded into 
Kuttaher, when a band of Afghans, headed 
by Daonda Adoola, who had been lately 
dismissed from the service of Hafiz Rhamot» 
took him prisoner. Tbey con6ned him in a 
strong hold, on the banks of the Gurra; and 
on the approach of the combined armies of 
the English and Sujah Dow la, they left him 
exposed to the miseries of famine ; but when 
obliged to fly to the woods of Cummow^ they 
forced him to accompany their flight, in 
hopes that he might be the means of procur- 
ing them terms with the English, whose 



11 



honour they knew to be equal to their va- 
lour. 

On their route to Gummow they were dis- 
covered by the Ryots of Raey Baodor, who 
by the orders of their master set fire to the 
wood in which they lay concealed ; attempt- 
iDg, by this act of cruelty, meanly to avenge 
CD these poor fugitives the death of his kin- 
dred and the loss of his Zimeendary. Gap- 
tain Percy, for this was the name of my 
amiable guest, fled with the rest ; being 
overpowered by fatigue, and alarmed by the 
yells of the tiger, he resolved to climb a tree 
for safety, and there to remain until he could 
put himself under the protection of a Hin- 
doo. The tree he attempted had been one 
left almost cut by my servants, but who had 
neglected to pull it down ; it unfortunately 
gave way to the pressure, and occasioned 
the fatal accident I have already mentioned. 

Thou knowest, O Maandaara, how my 
mind has ever thirsted after knowledge. 
Thou knowest with what ardour 1 have

ever performed my Foojak SeraswaUe^^ and 
that, at an age when few yoang men have 
read the Beids of the Shaster,! I had not 
only studied the sacred pages, but had perus- 
ed every famous writing in the Shanscrit 
language. 

The acquisition of the Persick tongue 
opened to me a door of knowledge which I 
was not slow to enter. History, for some- 
time, became my favourite study. But what 
did the history of states and empires present 
to my view? Alas! what, but the weak- 
ness and the guilt of mankind ? I beheld 
the few, whom fortune had unhappily placed 
in view of the giddy eminences of life, put- 
ting the reins of ambition into the bloody 
hand of cruelty, lash through torrents of per- 
fidy and slaughter, till, perhaps, overthrown 
in their career, they were trampled on by 
others who were running the same guilty 
race : or if they survived to reach the goal

they aimed at, living but to breathe the air 
of disappoint men t, and then drop into the sea 
of oblivion. Such is the history of the few 
"whose guilty passions and atrocious deeds 
have raised them to renown^ and to whom 
the stupid multitude, the willing instruments 
of their ambition, the prey of their avarice, 
and the sport of their pride, have given the 
appellation of heroes. 

To the great body of tlie people 1 never 
eould perceive that it made any difiference 
who it was that held the scorpion whip of 
oppression, as into whatever hand it was by 
them conveyed, they were equally certain of 
feeling the severity of its sting. Meditating 
on these things, the deep sigh of desponden- 
cy has burst from my heart. Cati^ it he, 
said I to myself, that the omnipotent and 
eternal Ruler of the universe should create 
such multitudes for no other purpose but to 
swell the triumphs of a fellow mortal, whose 
glory rises in proportion to the misery he in- 
flicts upon the human race ? Surely, by

of the earth, virtae is a shadow, and the love 
of it, which I have heretofore cherished in 
my breast, is nothing but the illusive phan- 
tom of a dream t 

By conversing with my English guest I 
got a different view of human nature. 
Through the medium of the Persick litera- 
ture it appeared universally darkened by 
depravity. In the history of Europe it as- 
sumed a milder form. In Europe man has 
not always^ as in Asia, been degraded by 
slavery, or corrupted by the possession of 
despotick power. Whole nations have there 
acknowledged the rights of human nature, 
and while they did so have attained to the 
summit of true glory. The Romans, whom 
the Persian* writers represent as the lawless 
invaders and ff^arless conquerors of the 
world ; and the Greeks, whom they load with 
every opprobrium, were in fact nations of 
lieroes. S|mruing the chain of slavery,

ary.

'they ^wisely thought that human nature ivas 
too imperfect to be entrusted with unlimited 
authority ; while they performed Poojah to 
the Goddess of Liberty, their hearts were en- 
larged by the possession of every virtue. She 
taught them the art of victory ; strengthened 
their nerves in the day of battle ; and, when 
they returned from the field of conquest, she 
gave sweetness to the banquets of simplicity, 
and rendered poverty honourable by her 
stniies. At length. Wealth and Luxury, the 
enemies of the Goddess, entered their domin- 
ions, and enticed the people from the worship 
of Liberty ; who, offended by their infidelity, 
entirely forsook their country, making Happi- 
ness and Virtue the companions of her flight. 
On a re-examination of the conduct of these 
illustrious heroes, who, while their nation 
performed Poojah to Liberty, had gained 
the summit of fame, Percy pointed out to 
my view many imperfections, which while 
my breast was enflamed by the first ardour 
of admiration had escaped my notice. The 
love of Liberty itself, that glorious plant as 



16 

be called it, which if properij coltivated 
■oever fails to profluce (he fruits of virtue, 
sprung not (he said) in the Greciao, or the 
Roman breast, from the pure soil of universal 
benevolence* but from the rank roots of pride 
and sel6shness. It never therefore extend- 
ed to embrace the human race. This per- 
fection of virtue was unlsnown in the world,- 
till taught by the religion of Christ. This 
last assertion of Percy's appeared to me as 
a prejudice unfounded in truth. But such 
are ever the hasty conclusions of ignorance- 
I had been taught to believe that the pore 
doctrine of t>enevolence and mercy was 
unknown to all but the favoured race of 
Brahma ; that the Christian faith, like that 
of the Mussulmnns, was a narrow system of 
superstitious adherence to the wildest pr^u- 
dices, engendering hatred, and encouraging 
merciless persecution against all who differ 
ed from them. Nothing can be more errone- 
ous than this idea of Christianity. By the 
indulgence of my English friend I was fa- 
voured with the perusal of the Christian 



u 

Shaster.* The precepts it contains are sim- 
ple, pure, and powerful, all addressed to the 
beart, and calculated for restoring the univer- 
sal peace and happiness which has been 
banished from the earth since the days of the 
Sottee Jogue-t 

The love of liberty in a people who are 
taught by the fundamental precepts of their 
Shaster, Mo do to others as they would have 
others do to them,* rises above the narrow 
spirit of selfishness, and extendeth to em- 
brace the human race t Benevolent people of 
England ! it is their desire, that all should be 
partakers of the same blessings of liberty

which they themselves eiyoy. It was doubt- 
less with this gloriouy view that they sent 
forth colonies to enlighten and instruct the 
vast regions of America. To disseminate' 
the love of virtue and freedom, they cultivat- 
ed the trans-Atlantick isles: 'and to rescue 
awr nation from the hands of the oppressor, 
did this brave and generous people visit the 
shores of Hindostan ! 

You may imagine how desirous I was to 
become acquainted with some particulars 
concerning the form of government, laws, 
and manners, of this highly favoured nation. 
Provided the above particulars are fru«, it ia 
of course to expect that they must all be 
formed after the model of perfection; and 
such, according to my conception of the ac- 
counts of Percy, they undoubtedly are. 

It having pleased Brahma to create them 
all of one cast, among them are no distinc- 
tions, but such as are the reward of virtue. 
It is not there as in the profligate court of 
Delhi, where great riches, a supple adhe- 
Tence to the minister, and a base and venal 



19 

approbation of the measareg of the court, can 
lead to titles and lilistinction. No. In En- 
gland, the honours of nobility are invaria- 
bly bestowed according to intrinsick merit. 
The titles and privileges of these heroes of 
the first class descend to their children. We 
may well suppose what care is bestowed on 
the edacation of these young nobles, whose 
minds are moulded into wisdom at Universi- 
ties instituted for the purpose ; where vice 
and folly are aUke unknown : and where the 
faculties of a young man might have as great 
a cbance of gettting leave to rust in igno- 
rance as to be lost in dissipation ! From 
these seminaries of virtue they are called to 
the Senate of the nation ; where they debate 
with all the gravity and the interest that 
might be expected from their early habits 
of serious thought and deep investigation. 
The sons of the King, at an early age, take 
their seats in that tribunal, from whose de- 
cision there lies no appeal. As their exam- 
ple 18 supposed to animate the young No- 
bility, it may well be imagined how wise, 



20 

c 

learned, grave, and pioas, these princely 
yoatYw must be : their actions are tloubtleM 
the mirrors of decorum, and their lips the 
gates of wisitom! 

The equality of human bein^ in the si^cht 
of Goil being taught by their religion, it is a 
fundamental maxim of their policy, that no 
laws are binding which do not obtain the 
consent of the people. All laws are there- 
fore issued by the sanction of their represent 
tatives; every separate district, town, and 
community, choosing from among them* 
selves the persons most distinguished for 
pieti^, msdm, leuming and itUegrityy impart 
to them the power of acting in the name of 
the whole. 

About four hundred of these eminent men»

or ambition, thej pursue with steady steps, 
the path of equity, and have nothing so much 
at heart as the publiclc welfare. No war can 
be engaged in, and no taxes imposed, but by 
the consent of these patriot chiefs. Judge 
then, my friend, how light the burden must 
be, that is laid on by these representatives, 
these brothers of the people. Never can such 
men as these be instrumental in sending war, 
with all its attendant miseries, into the nations 
of the earth, all of whom they are taught by 
their Shaster to consider as brethren. In 
Asia we behold the gory monster, ever ready 
to stalk forth with destructive stride at the 
▼Dice of ruthless tyranny ; but in Europe, 

employed in danciog, singing, and playing on musical in- 
ftruments. Nor shall he go to any place without a cause,

Many uT uur Pundits have contemplated 
with astonishment the animosities that have 
arisen among the folJoMrers of the Arabian 
prophet, on account of the different Interpret 
tations iriven by their* 1 maxims to certain 
passages of the Koran ; forgetting that tbe

that He who hath not formed any two oK)- 
jects in bis vast creation exactly similar, 
took doubtless no less care upon the , forma- 
tion of tbe human mind, perceiveth with 
delight the contrarieties of opinion among 
men. They have carried their presump- 
tion so far, that one sect hath dared to con- 
eeive hatred and ill will against another, 
for not viewing every dark passage in the 
writings of their Prophet exactly in the 
same light ! How different is the case with 
the Chrbtian ? The great Founder of their

religion baving left every man at liberty to 
cbuoee the form of worship which he finds 
beat calculated to excite and to express 
sentimeots of devotion, they each attach 
themselves to the form most agreeable to 
their own minds, allowing the same liberty 
to others, and convinced that all are equally 
acceptable to the Deity, who acquiesce in 
bis laws and obey his commanclments. in 
the domitiions of the MussnlmHns, though 
all sects are permitted to live, it is one sect 
alone (the orthodox^) that is invested with 
power, or entrusted with authority. But 
among Christians what sect exists, that 
would accept of the most beneficial distinc- 
tions on terms so contrary to the spirit of 
their Gospel ? No. All sects, equal in the 
eye of Heaven, must neels. by the wise and 
virtuous Legislators of this happy country, 
be admitted iuto an equal enjoyment of 
every right and every privilege. The

Priests of their religion are, as tbeir cha- 
racters are fully set forth io their Shaster, 
men who despise the adventitious advanta- 
ges of rank and fortune, who regard no di- 
stinctions in their flock but the distinctions 
arising from internal worth and intrinsick 
goodness ; not thirsting after worldly ho- 
nours; not given to luxury; strangers to 
avarice and pride. Having no bitterness 
against those who differ from them in opin- 
ion, animosity, strife, or wrath, is never 
heard of among these holy men, who, in the 
language of their Shaster, ' pass through 
things temporal, only mindful of those which 
are eternal.' Although my unwearied ap- 
plication to the study of the English lan- 
guage enables me to read a few passages in 
that tongue, it is to the Arabick copy of those 
books of the Shaster, called Gospels, to 
which I am indebted for tiie accuracy of my 
information. 

Not presuming to lift the veil of mystery 
with which some passages are enveloped 
(a presumption which in a stranger would 



25 



be equally unpardonable and unbecoming,) 
I pass over whatever appears to be mysteri- 
ous with the most profound respect. But 
that power which taught me to sweep from 
my lieart the dust of prejudice, taught me 
also to pay homage to excellence, wherever 
it might be found. In the precepts of the 
Christian Shaster I behold the grandeur 
of sublimity and the simplicity of truth. 
There is one particular so novel, so peculiar, 
so repugnant to the universally received 
opinions of mankind, that it considerably 
excited my astonishment. In the revelation 
bestowed upon the Christians, women are 
considered in the light of rational beings ! 
free agents ! in short, as a moiety of the hu- 
man species, whose souls are no less precious 
in the eye of the Omniscient than that of 
the proud lords of the creation ! What can 
be more extraordinary ? 

The inferiority of women appears so esta- 
blished by the laws of nature, and has been 
80 invariably inculcated by all the legisla- 
tors sent by Brahma to enlighten the eight 

VOL. I. 3 



26 



corners of the world, that it seems altoge* 
ther incontestibie. It is true that our di- 
vine laws (incomparable In wisdom!) do 
not, like the laws of the Mussulmans, ab- 
solutely exclude women from the participa- 
tion of happiness in a future state, it being 
written in the Shaster, ' ikal a woman who 
hums herself with her husband^ shnU live 
with him in Paradise three crore and fifty 
lacks of years.^ But even in this case, it is 
contested by the Pundits, that her admis^ 
sion into Paradise depends on her husbaod^s 
title to an entrance into that state of feli- 
city. Uncertain tenor! precarious depea« 
dance! on which a poor woman commits 
herself to the flames ! Wisely did our law- 
givers ordain, that ignorance and suhmissioa 
should be the ornaments of women ; seeing 
how much the privilege of inquiry might 
have disquieted their repose ! 

Christian women are more fortunate; they 
may enjoy Heaven without the company of 
their husbands! Throughout the Christian 
Shaster they are enalted to perfect equality 



«7 



with man. They are considered as occupy- 
ing a station of equal dignity in the intelli- 
gent creation, and as being equally accoun- 
table for the use they make of the gift of 
reason and the monitions of conscience* 
What care ! what pains 1 roust we then con- 
clude to be bestowed by Christians on th« 
formation of the female mind ? * As the 
be^ms of the moon kindle the flowers of the 
Oshadi, so,* says the philosopher, *doth edu- 
cation enpand the blossoms of intelUgenre.* 
Where women are destined to be under no 
control but that of reason, under no restraint 
save the abiding consciousness of the sea rrh- 
Ing eye of Omnipotence, of what vrfst impor- 
tance must their education appear in the 
eyes of the enlightened! Accordingly we 
find that seminaries of female instruction, 
called Boarding-schools, are in England 
universally established; where, by what I 
xan learn, the improvement of the under- 
standing is as successfully attended to, and 
every solid and useful accomplishment as 
fully attained, as are the severe morals of 



28 



Christianity by I heir brotVera at the univer- 
sity. When the females of EDgland have 
completed their education in these seats of 
science, these nurseries of wisdom, they 
come forth like the mother of Krishna, the 
torch of reason enlightening their minds, 
and the staff of knowledge supporting their 
virtue ! In that enlightened country, a wife 
is the friend of her husband. Motive^ of 
esteem influence the choice of both; for 
there women are at liberty to choose, or to 
reject offers of marriage, and educated as 
they are we may well suppose how wisely 
they will always choose! By their religion, 
men are prohibited from having more than 
one wife at a time, which at first view will 
doubtless appear a hardship in your eyes: 
but if you consider what an endless source 
of disquiet, the quarrelSfjealousies and strifes 
among our wives frequently produce, you 
will perhaps ackoovv ledge that to lessen the 
number is not so great a misfortune. 

What I have said concerning the cultiva- 
tion of the female understanding will per- 



29 

haps appear ridiculouB in yoor eyes; but 
take the following proof of Ihe vewcily of 
my assertion. One day that I hud been 
studying the Shaster of my English guest, 
I perceived, written in fair and lgible cha- 
racters, upon the first leaf, these wonis; 
* The parting gift of Charlotte Percy to the 
most beloved of brothers.* I carried the 
book to my friend, who was still confined to 
his couch, and asked him if Charlotte was 
the name of his brother ? Be answered with 
a smile, that Charlotte was the name of his 
dear and amiable sister. * Your sister!' re- 
peated I, with astonishment, 'Can it be, 
that in your country a woman is permitted 
to touch the Shaster ? or are women taught 
to write ? It cannot be. Such things are 
not proper for women.' He replied, that my 
surprise was occasioned by having always 
been accustomed to behold the sex in the 
degrading state b( subjection. A state 
which, wherever it prevails, subdues the 
vigour and destroys the virtue of the human 
mind. Man, he observed, received from

nature no passion so powerfal as the love of 
tyranny. This, the superiority of bodily- 
strength had enabled him to exercise over 
the weaker part of his species with uncon- 
trolled sway. In proportion as society ad- 
vanced in civilization, the advantages of 
reason over bodily strength prevailed, and 
the passions received from the fetters of re- 
straint a degree of polish, which, if it did not 
change their nature, rendered them less dis- 
gustingly ferocious. The wife of a Hindoo, 
continued he, is from this cause treated with 
more respect, and enjoys a much greater 
degree of liberty and happiness, than the 
wife of an untutored Afghan. But it is not 
in the nature of man to relinquish claims so 
flattering to his pride ; and the innate love 
of the exercise of despotick authority must 
have for ever kept the female sex in a state 
of subjection, had not the powerful mandate 
of religion snapped their chains. This, the 
religion received by the Christians has fully 
accomplished : and to shew you how much 
it is in the power of education to improve 



31 



the female mind, continued my friend, I 
shall translate, for your perusal, isome of the 
letters of that sister whose name is written 
in the leaf of the book you are now reading. 
According to this promise, my excellent 
friend translated for me several pieces both 
io prose and verse, presenting me at the 
same time with copies of the originals that 
I might compare them together. By that 
which I have enclosed for your satisfaction, 
you will perceive that the sister of Percy 
has not only learned to read and write, but 
is in a considerable degree capable of think- 
iag. Nursed in solitude, she in early youth 
took delight to string the pearls of poetry. 
I send you one of the first of these gems of 
fancy, which though it boasts not the ra- 
diant brilliancy of the Diamond, is pleasing 
as the varying Opal, and soft as the lustre 
of the green Emerald. It was written after 
having refused an invitation to a party of 
pleasure on account of her duty to an aged 
uncle, who had adopted her as his daughter, 
and of whom she speaks with the language 



S2 



of tlW afrection. Let it be read wUh ean^

So exquisite, as is the conscious power 
A reoerable parent's days to cheer P 

kh t then, from thee, my guardian and my friend, 
Let never vagrant wish presume to stray; 

But on my steps let filial love attend, 
Geotly to sooth thy Jife*s declining day. 

Can 1 forget what to thy love I owM ? 

Forget thy goodnesfi to my orphan state? 
Forget the boons thy tenderness bestowM ? 

Or thy unchanged affection's early date ? 

When my lov'd father presaM his early bier, 
(From which, alas ! nor youth nor love could save) 

And when my widow'd mother (doom severe !) 
Victim of sorrow I sunk into the grave. 

Thy care a more than father's care supplied, 
Thy breast a more than father's fondness knew, 

Led by thy hand, or cherish'd at thy side. 
My infant years in sprightly pleasures j3ew. 

No firowa from thee repress'd the harmless joy. 
No harsh reproof repell'd the lively thought. 

Pleas'd, thou couldst smile on childhood's simplest toy, 
And say, * no pleasures were so cheaply bought.' 

Can I forget the partner of thy cares ? 

Whose kind attention form'd my early youth ; 
Or with what care she watch'd a)y tender years ; 

And in lifes's morning sow'd the seeds of truth ?

Thus far did Zaarmilla write to his friend 
Haandaara, by the slave who perished in 
the Bwelliogs of the Jumna. Captain Percy 
had been then five months under the shadow 
of my roof; the skill of the Afghan had not 
been sufficient to join the fractured bone ; 
BO that great pain was inflicted upon him. 
I had often attempted to get an account of 
big situation transmitted to the English camp, 
but without success. The troops of the Af* 
gbans surrounded me, and the danger of disco- 
vering to them, that an English officer was in 
their power, obliged me to act with the ut« 
most circumspection* At length, in the 
month Assen (October) the treaty was con- 
cluded between the Khan of Rainpore and 
the great powers. I besought and obtained 
leave from Fyzoola Khan to go myself to 
the camp of the English, which was yet at 
the foot of the mountains. Captain Percy, 
weakened by the langour of disease, and 



36 



sinking under the pressore of incessant pain, 
revived at my proposal : the big tear glis- 
tened in his eye, and pressing oiy hand be- 
tween his« God shall bless thee, my dear 
Zaarmilla, cried he, the God of Heavea 
shall bless thee for thy kindness to me. In 
contemplating the approaching dissolution 
of my being, unshaken confidence in the 
mercies of my God and Saviour support my 
soul. Death has for me no terrors; but 
roethinks it would brighten the dark pas- 
sage that leads to it^ could I again behold 
any of my former friends and countrymen > 
their accounts would soften to my sister the 
tidings of an event that will pierce her soul. 
She knows not the goodness of Zaarmilla, 
and will only imagine to herself the figure of 
her dying brother expiring among strangers. 
Could she be assured how often my suf 
ferings have been alleviated by the balm 
of sympathy, and how much the endearing 
sensibilities of cordial friendship have re. 
freshed my soul, it would be a solace to ber 
affliction.

He then wrote as much as strength would 
permit, to a British officer, who was bis par- 
ticular friend, and enclosing it in a few lines 
to the commander in chief, delivered it iato 
my hands. 

I pursued my journey to the foot of the 
mountains, attended only by a small re- 
tinue* When we reached the place of our 
destination, we had the mortificatioti to find 
that it had been for some time abandoned 
by the English, who were on their march 
down the country. I did not hesitate to fol* 
low them; though, being unused to traTel, 
I was overtaken by fatigue, and annoyed by 
the rains, which began at this time to net in 
with great violence. 

After a tedious and disi^reeable journey, 
I at length reached Rhamgaut, where the 
English army, at the request of the Vizier, 
had for some time halted. I was received 
by the commander with the eye of kind- 
ness, and recommended by him to hb gffl- 
cers with the voice of praise. The chief 
to whom captain Percy had written, wei-

eomed me in the warmth of friendship, and 
bestowed upon my eondnet anmerited eulo- 



! 



Soon as my limba had recovered from 
the wearinem of fatigue, this Saib, and an- 
other dear and Intimate friend of the on- 
fortonate Percy, who was deeply skilled 
in the science of medicine, purposed re- 
toming with me, in order to solace, and 
if possible to restore the amiable youth. 
The rains continued to descend; but the 
spirit of true friendship rises superiour to 
every obstacle. We carried with as the 
good wishes of an host of friends, and, sup- 
ported by hope, accomplished our journey 
In safety. 

From the accounts I had communicated 
concerning the situation of our friend, doc- 
tor Denlieigh, the friend on whose know 
ledge in the healing art his brother officers 
placed so much reliance, had pronounced 
great hopes concerning him; hopes which 
inspired the alacrity of cheerfulness, Alas ! 
as the blood-stained tiger of the forest rushes 



38 

on the timid fawn, who unconscioua of his 
presence, sports within the reach of his fe- 
rocious grasp, so doth calamity dart upon the 
cherished hope of mortals. 

When we approached my dwelling, the 
Ehansaman, under whose particular care I 
had left my friend, came out to meet us* 
His eyes were heavy with the tears of grief, 
and his whole deportment was marked by 
the pressure of recent sorrow. I was afraid 
to question him, lest his answer should be- 
reave me of hope ; trat at length my tongue 
articulated Percy's name. Alas! my fears 
were just. The pure spirit had fled from its 
corporeal confinement to the boundless ex- 
ntosion of infinity. Three days had elapsed 
sfnce the body, deserted by its celestial in- 
habitant, had been committed to the earth; 
I visited the dust which covered it, and 
gave vent to the grief that oppressed my 
soul. The friends of Percy united their 
tears with mine: they were the pure of- 
fering of friendship flowing from hearts of 
sincerity. After we had iodulged the first 



40 



impulses of grief, the Rhansaman presented 
us witli the papers inrhich our friend had con- 
signed to his care. These ivere a sealed 
packet, directed to his sister^ a letter to his 
English friend, with directions concerning 
Jiis effects, and an epistle to me, written with 
the pen of affection* To me he bequeathed » 
as a token of his love, the little shrill-voiced 
monitor, whose golden tongue proclaims the 
laape of time, called in English a repeating 
watch, his sister's picture, together with all 
the manuscripts of her writings his English 
Shaster, and, in short, all that was about hii 
person when I had the happiness of receiv- 
ing him under my roof. I have since penis- 
ed with care the precious relicts of this amia- 
ble young man. In the leaves of his pocket- 
book were written many valuable remarks^ 
some of which had evidently been deposited 
there but a short time before the Angel of 
Death arrested the hand which wrote them. 
Among his loose papers were several pages ; 
entitled, 'Thoughts on the Prevalence of 
Infidelity;' in which the names of Hume^ 



41 

Boliogbroke, and Voltaire, frequently occur. 
It will oblige me if you inquire of the 
Immaum Yuseph Ib'n Medi for tome infor> 
mation concerning these men; who, I make 
no doubt, are of the sect of Hanbal, against 
whose opinions the Mussulman doctots so 
bitterly inveigh. What makes me certain 
they are not Christians is, that from what 
Percy has said concerning their opinions, it 
is evident that these unhappy men are un- 
conscious of the precious spark of immortality' 
which glows within -their bosoms. Nay, so 
much are they inflated by vanity, so in- 
fatuated by the spirit of pride, as to utter 
words of arrogance with the tongue of pre- 
sumption; saying, that men ought no^ to be- 
HeVe in the supreme Inheritor of eternity. 

Our departed friend concludes his remarks 
upon these people in the following words : 

* Te who are so keen to disseminate the 
baneful principles of infidelity, did ye know 
what it is to watch the slow but steady steps 
of death ; to behold his approach in the si- 
lence of solitude, where the whispers of vani- 

TOI* I. 4* 



42 



ty are onheard, and the smaU stiU voice of 
eonseienee alone speaks audibly to the soul, 
ye would not, surely, be so rashly forward to 
dash from the lips of a fellow mortal the cor- 
dial draught of hope, aud to offer in its stead 
the bitter cup of doubt, uncertainty, and 
despair ! 

^ The principles of religion are so con- 
genial to the human mind, that I am con- 
vinced they would almost always remain 
permanent, was it not for the adventitious 
prejudices with which the pure and simple 
doctrines of Christianity are so entangled by 
the zealous adherents of every sect and party* 

* Of all my contemporaries, they have ever 
been the foremost to throw off the restraints 
of religion, who have been what is termed 
most strictly educated; but who never had 
any religious sentiments impressed upon^heir 
minds distinct from the particular dogmas of 
their respective sects. With these dogmas 
their ideas of the truth of Christianity were 
inseparably combined ; and when they after- 
ward came to mingle with the world, and 



4S 

foond their prejudices untenable against the 
attack of argument, the force ofreason, or the 
sneer of ridicule^ the whole fabrick of their 
faith was shaken to the foundation. Blessed 
be the memoiy of the parent who instructed 
me ; whose care it was to impress npon my 
mind the strictest principles with the most 
liberal opinions. In her eyes the mode of 
worship was nething ; the spirit from which 
it proceeded was every thing.' 

* My feelings tell me that the lamp of life 
is nearly exhausted. Never more shall I be- 
hold the face of a friend. No sister's friend- 
ly hand to smooth my pillow, or to sooth my 
soul with the tender accents of affection. 
My impatience for the pleasure of seeing my 
friend Grey, has deprived me of the comfort 
I have hitherto received from the consoling 
sympathy and unremitting kindness of the 
amiable Hindoo. 

* Remote from country, friends, and all that 
my heart has been accustomed to hold dear ; 
— ^but what, in a moment like this, could 
friends or country do for me? what, but to 



44 

■ point the parting angnifth.' I am tud alOne. 
No. The ever-present God is with me; 
and his comrorts support my soul. Often in 
the hour or liealth, have I repeated with 
rapture the lines of the poet : and now I am 
clilled to be an evidence of their truth. 



^ SboQld fate commaad me to the farthest verge 
Of the greea earth, to dittant barbarous climes, 
Rivers ankoown to soog j where first the sua 
Gilds Indian mountains, or bis setting beam 
Flames on th* Atlantick isles ; 'tis nought to me: 
Smce God is ever present, ever felt, 
lo the void waste as in the dty full ; 
And where His spirit breathes there imist be joy. 
When e^en, at last, the solemn hour shall come 
And wiog my mystick flight to fature worlds, 
I cheerful will obey ; there, with new powers 
Will linng wonders sing. I cannot go . 
Where univeraal love not smiles around.'** 

Such, O ! Maandaara, was the conclusion 
of the life of this European. His two friends 

^AsZaarmilla was unable to proceed fertiier in the 
translation, we have thought proper to fill up the blank 
with what we imagine to have been the poetical passage 
sJluded to by Captain Percy. 



45 

abode with me for a few day6, and departed, 
loaded with eveiy mark of my friendship and 
esteem. I was no sooner left alone, than 
melancholy took possession of my mind. 
The conversation of Captain Percy gava 
light to my soal ; it was at an end ; and dark- 
ness again surrounded me. 

The Rajah of Lolldong and his brother, 
the Zimeendar, heard of my affliction and 
came to comfort me. Alas ! they were both 
too full of their own concerns to take any 
part in the grief which filled my heart. In 
the late calamities of our nation, their lands 
had been ravaged by the troops of the Vizier* 
The protecting hand of the English had not 
been able to save their villages from the mtb- 
less hand of the destroyer ; and their Ryots 
were consequently unable to pay their rents* 
I listened to the story of their distresses with 
concern, and said all in my power to comfort 
them. A second, and a third time, they re- 
peated the particulars of their grievances; 
and though they lioth usually spoke at once* 
still I listened with patience. But when I 



48 

found them obstinately persist in chemhing 
tbe feelings of selfish regret for their own 
particular misfortune, while the miseries of 
thousands, who, on the same occasion, had 
lost their all, found no entrance into their 
hearts, I could no longer listen to their com- 
plaints with the semblance of attention f and> 
perceiving that they wearied me, they de- 
parted. 

In the innocent and playful vivacity of the 
little Zamarcanda I have found a better sub- 
stitute for intellectual enjoyment than in the 
tiresome solemnity of sententious dnlneas. 
But still the soft dew of contentment sheds 
not its divine influence on the dwelling of 
Zaarmilla. My mind is tossed in the whirl- 
wind of doubt, and bewildered in tbe laby- 
rinth of conjecture : but let not Maandaara 
mistake the word of his friend ; let bun not 
imagine that my veneration for the Gods of 
my fathers can be lessened by the words of 
a stranger : or, that I am so far misled, as to 
conceive that the greatest portion of wisdom 
bestowed by Brahma upon any nation in the 



47 



world's circamference, can bear any com- 
parison with that which has been given in 
the sacred Vedas. No. I bow with reve- 
rence while I pronounce the name of the 
sacred volumes ; and confess that in Rigya- 
jah8§A' Harva the immortal treasures of 
trae knowledge are deposited. 

But in what text of the Veda, Upa Veda, 
Vedanga, Purana, Dherma, or Dhersana,*^ is 
it forbidden to contemplate the operation of 
Maya throughout the sea-girt earth ? Why 
should I remain in doubt as to the truth of 
the accounts given me by the young Chris- 
tian ? Why should I not satisfy my mind by 
a farther acquaintance with his countrymen* 
by which alone I can discover whether his 
words have been dictated by the spirit of de- 
lusion, or emanated from the heart of in- 
tegrity ? 

If his accounts are just ; if the book he has 
given me he indeed the Shasterof the Chris- 

* The aiz great Shasten, on which all knowledge, divine 
and human, is sapposed to be comprehended. See Asia* 
tick Researches, vol. i, article IS. 



48 

tiaaff, I eao, ih that ease, have no doabt of its 
being the guide of their practice, as well as 
the rule of their faith ; nor help feeling an a^ 
dent desire for knowing more of men, whose 
conversation must be so full of purity^ and 
whose lives are devoted to good works ! 

What I ;have already learned from the 
worthy European, whose death has caused 
the arrow of affliction to rankle in my bosom, 
so far from hurting my mind, has served but 
to invigorate my virtue. It is by the breath 
of Ganesa, that the flame of curiosity has 
been kindled in my bosom. And wherefore 
should I not indulge myself in following that 
path to knowledge, which the spirit that en- 
lighteneth my understanding impelleth me to 
pursue ? If the sun of science, whicb rose 
with radiant splendour on our eastern hemi- 
sphere, now beams its fervid rays upon the 
regions of the west, why should I be prevent- 
ed from following its glorious courae ? 

Thou wilt, perhaps, tell me of what I owe 
to my Cast, my country, and my people. 
As to the first, thou knowesty that the ac- 



4» 

qfoxewMnt of knowledge is not a daty con- 
fiaed to the race which sprang from the 
month of Brahma; and though it is necessary 
that every Hindoo should keep himself free 
from contamination^ jet many holy men 
have found it possible to do so, in the strict- 
est flense, even while they made their abode 
in the dwellings of Mahommedans and Chris- 
tians^ No opportunity could offer m»e far 
voiifable than the present, for quitting my 
country, without pr^udice to my own inter- 
est or that of my people. The peace which 
kas been happily restored to us is ensured 
by the faith of our deliverers : and, more- 
over, the wisdom, generosity, and clemency, 
which adorn the character of Fyzoola Khan,^ 
give the best pledge for the security of our 
pottessions. 

I have, therefore, no obstacle to surmount 
hi the accomplishment of my wishes but one. 
It is the disposal of Zamarcanda. Could I 
leave her in the possession of my friend, my

miDd would be at rest. And who so worthy 
to be the wife of Maandaara as the sister of 
Zaarmifia ? She is yet in the tenderness of 
youth, but is accomplished in all that oar 
laws permit women to learn. Her mind is 
pure as the liliy that bends its silver head 
over the transparent stream. Modesty is en- 
shioed in her cheeks, and beauty sparkles 
through the deep fringe which encircles her 
ground-kissing eyes. The blood of a thou- 
sand Rajahs flows through her veins, and her 
Ayammi Shadee'*' shall be worthy of the love 
of her brother. If this proposal seemeth good 
in thine eyes, I will meet thee at Ferrocha- 
bad, in the middle of the month Ph(^oan,t

maiden from the hands of thy friend.

LETTER n. 



The fMSt faithful of Friends, Kisheen Negaj 
Msandalira; to the Powerful and enlightened 
Rajahj Seeta Juin Zaarmilla. 

125 

Praise be to VeeshnCL ! The long vrisbed- 
for letter from the frieDd of my youth hath 
kindled the fire of conflicting passions in the 
ii: breast of Maandaara. The assurance of thy 
Tjc continued kindness lights the spark of joy ; 
.It but the intelligence of the infatuation that 
'if> hath seized thy naind envelopes nay soul in- 
the dark cloud of despair. I perceive that 
'0 thou art under the influence of enchant- 
ment, and that that false stranger hath used 
some charm to deceive thy understanding. 
^^ What would the spirit of thy father, what 
li? would the learned Pundit, to whose instruc- 
tions we are equally indebted, what would 



52 

they ptonouiiee, coold they hear that Zaar- 
iiiilla thoqght it necessary to sojourn among 
infidels and impioos eaters of blood, in order 
to acquire knowledge? Can a race who 
sprung frooi the dust that was shaken from 
the feet of Brahma, and wlio are on tfaat 
aceoont lieneath the meanest Sooder, wlio is 
honoured in being permitted to tondi thy 
sandals, a race, wlio though less savage than 
that of the Mussulmans with regard to tboss 
that bear the human form, exceed them in 
cruelty to all the other animated inhabitants 
of the earth. Can any of this race be capa- 
ble of* instructing the descendant of a thou- 
sand Rajahs? Impossible. From the ant 
thon mayest learn industry. From the dog 
thou mayest be instructed in Caithfalness. 
The horse may teach thee diligence, and 
the elephant instruct thee in patience, mag- 
nanimity, and wisdom ; but expect not from 
Europeans to attain the knowledge of anj 
virtue. How should they be learned that 
are but of yesterday ? Their remotest annals 
extend but to the trifling period of a few 



53 



ttaoasancl yean. While enlightened and in- 
■tructed in mystery, we can trace the history 
of rerolving ages through the amazing period 
of the four Jogues. 

I am not, however, surprised that you 
should be the dupe of their enchantments. I 
know how far the evil genii have assisted 
them in that art : of their proficiency in it I 
had myself a very convincing proof. 

When the English Saib, to whom Rureha 
Bedwan was Mounshi, abode at Agra, he 
took pleasure in astonishing those who went 
to visit him with a display of his magical 
skill. Among several other tricks, he made 
the whole company, consisting of more than 
twenty persons, lay hold of each other's 
hands, and form a circle, and then by turn- 
log the handle of a little instrument, compos- 
ed only of metal and glass, but which, I sup- 
pose, must have contained the evil spirits 
obedient to his command; he, all at once, 
caused such a sensation to pass through the 
arms of the company, as if a sudden stroke 
bad broken the bone, which was not, how-

ever, on examination, foand to be in tlui 
least injured. As all felt it precisely at the 
same moment, it was impossible that he conld 
have touched each of us, and therefore it is 
evident that it could be nothing but magick 
that could produce so extraordinary an ef* 
feet. At another time he shut out the pierc- 
ing light of day, which has always been un* 
favourable to such practices, and made ns 
behold armies of men, and elephants, and 
horses, pass before us on the wall. When 
they disappeared, they were succeeded by a 
raging sea, vomiting fire, and foaming with 
all the appearance of a tremendous storm. 
Ships rolled upon the bosom of the deep ; 
and men who appeared wild with distress, 
and panting in the agony of terrour, were 
exerting themselves to save their lives and 
preserve their ships from the pointed rocka 
which environed them. This sight of hor- 
rour drew tears from our eyes ; and we burst 
into exclamations of sorrow. When lo ! in 
a moment, the sun being admitted into the 
apartment, the scene vanished, and we saw 



55 

nothing bnt the hangings which formerly 
adorned the wall. 

Would the son of Coashfaind forsake the 
land of his fathers, and wander to regions 
ivhich the glorious luminary of heaven 
scarcely designs to irradiate with his golden 
beams, to learn tricks like these? Sureiy 
there are jugglers enough in Hindostan who 
would, for a small reward, instruct him in the 
mysteries of the magick art; and as the 
devils they employ are of our own country, 
they most be of a less pernicious nature than 
those of strangers. 

So far from being guided by wisdom, the 
laws by which these people are governed 
are abominable and absurd : which I shall 
demonstrate to you by the following facts, 
of which I was myself an eye witness during 
my short abode at their camp. Like yon, I 
bad suffered my mind to be prejudiced in.fk- 
^our of a people whose conduct had been so 
favourable to our nation. The order and 
fegalarity which prevailed among them, im^ 
pressed me at first with the highest idea of 



56 

their virtue and wisdom. I had as yet seen 
no appearance of any religious ceremony 
among them, when, on the third day after 
my arrival, my attention was attracted hy a 
procession, which I immediately supposed to 
be in honour of their Dewtah. Curious to 
behold the nature of their ceremonies upon 
this occasion, I followed the procession, at 
which part of the camp assisted. When lo! 
to my equal surprise and horrour, I beheld 
one poor soldier stripped, tied up, and almost 
lacerated to death ; a thousand lashes being 
inflicted upon his nalced shoulders. That 
one of their priests should have undergone 
all this in voluntary penance, would not have 
surprised me. We every day see instances 
of greater sufferings than this inflicted by 
our Fakeers upon their own bodies. But I 
could not forbear astonishment, when inform- 
ed, that this cruel ceremony was performed 
as a punishment upon a soldier for the trifling 
crime of purloining a few rupees from one of 
his officers. Doubtless, thought I, the mo- , 
rals of the people must be very pure, in I 



whose eyes so small an offence can seem 
worthy of so great a ponishtnent. 

While I yet ruminated upon the scene 
which I had witnessed, I was called to the 
tent of an officer, who had, ever since my 
arrival at the camp, treated me with great 
kindness. I had not long conversed with 
Mm (for he spoke very good Mhors) when 
aeveral of his brother officers came to visit 
him. They conversed in their own Ian- 
gas^, and appeared* from the frequent 
bants of laughter which escaped them, to 
have entered upon a very pleasant topick. 
I was unwilling to lose the knowledge of a 
discourse which seemed to produce so moch 
mirth ; and applied to my interpreter for in- 
formation. He told me the subject of their 
merriment was the dishonour of one of their 
own countrymen, a Chief of rank and emi- 
nence, whose wife had suffered the torch of 
her virtue to be extinguished by the vile 
breath of a seducer. How great, cried I, 
most be the torture awaiting the wretch 
Who could be guilty of so great a crime 1 If 



58 

the poor pilferer of a few rupees was doomed 
to suffer so severely, what must the maa 
undergo, who could basely contaminate the 
bed of his fHend, rob him of his honour, and 
destroy his peace ? If the weight of the pu- 
nishment keeps pace with the gradation in 
atrocity, imagination can hardly paint to it- 
self any thing so dreadful as the sufferings to 
which this wretch must be condemned. 
This observation, repeated by my Mounshi» 
redoubled the mirth of the company ; and I 
heard, with astonishment, that the dishonour 
of one of these Ulustricus Europeans was to 
be compensated, not by the punishment of 
the aggressor^ not by the sacrifice of his life, 
and the degradation of his family, but by a 
sum of money ! Can virtue subsist among a 
people, who set a greater value upon a few 
pieces of silver, than upon their honour ? 

This circumstance did not fail to destroy 
the impression I had received in favour of 
these people. But I should, perhaps, have 
remained some longer time among them, 
had I not beheld a deed so horrible as filled 



.^ 69 

my aonl ivith indignation and disgust. Tes, 
my misguided friend,! saw tliese heroes, whom 
yon falsely imagine so pure, so harmless, so full 
of piety and benevolence, I saw them — my 
lieart shudders and my hand trembles while I 
relate it, I saw them devour, with looks that 
betokened the most savage satisfaction, the 
sacred offspring of a spotted cow. Tes, 
Zaarmilia, thb unhappy calf, for whom a 
thousand holy Fakeers would have risked 
their lives, was slain at the command of 
these inhuman Europeans, and devoured by 
them without one pang of remorse. 

Does not nature itself revolt at such an 
action ? And had any spark of religious 
knowledge enlightened their minds, would 
they not have perceived, that the calf they 
■lew, was, if not so learned, at least more 
pious and more uncontaminated by the cor- 
ruption of impure ideas, than themselves. 
Tell me no more of the virtue of ijpch men. 
And no more, I conjure thee, think of incur-

thy Cast, and forfeiting its sublime privi-

pleasure of the Dewtah, by neglecting' fo 
perform the duty to which every Hindoo is 
bound ; the indispensible duty of marriage. 
Four years have elapsed since, in obedtenee 
to the command of my father, I married the 
'^ daughter of the reverend Gopaul. Slie 
was ill-favoured, and of a bad temper : so 
that, being disgusted with her peevisbneflB, 
and still more with the plainness ef her 
countenance, (for in a beautiful weraaa 
many errours nlay he forgiven) I parted wit 
her some months since, and presenting her 
with her ayammi shadee^ sent her back to the 
house of her father. I will, therefore, wi^ 
great pleasure accept of your sister for my 
wife. Wjifx this intention, I sometime ago 
inquired after her disposition, and heard 
that she was t^eautiful and good tempered ; 
which is the utmost perfection in women.

To what pnrpoee should thej have judgment 
or understanding ? were'thej not ma^e sub- 
servient to the will of man? If they are 
docile and reserved, with enough of judg- 
ment to teach them to adorn their persons 
and wear their jewels with propriety, and 
never presuming to have a will of their own, 
follow implicitly the direction of their hus* 
bands, studying his temper, and accommo- 
dating themselves to his humour, it is all 
that can be wished for. As to all that you 
say of the cultivation of their understand- 
ings, I can only look upon it as the ravings 
of a distempered imagination. 

Bad as my opinion is of those English 
Christians, I cannot possibly imagine them 
to be so absurd as to teach learning to their 
women. Allowing it possible (which I am 
very far from allowing) that these creatqres, 
whose sole delight b finery, who were bom 
to amuse, to please, and to%ontinue the 
race of man, should be capable of entering 
the sacred porch which leads to the temple 
of knowledge, what woold be the conse-

quence of their being admitted to it ? would 
Uieir steps be steady enough to conduct 
them through the labyrinths of that awful 
fane ? No. Contenting themselves with the 
first tinsel ornament that caught their eyesi 
they would come out at the first opening of 
vanity ; and having made a deposit of their 
gentleness and humility, would clothe them- 
selves with the robes of arrogance, and rest 
dauntless upon the hollow reed of self-con- 
ceit. Such are the consequences that would 
result from the foolish attempt of teaching 
women more than nature designed them to 
know. 

Let Zaarmilla, therefore, hearken to the 
voice of reason ; and at the same time that 
he gives his sister to be the wife of his 
friend, let him accept for his spouse the sis- 
ter of Maandaara. Without being strictly 
beautiful, her countenance is pleasing: a 
mole of extreme beauty is seated on her 
cheek : and her eyes sparkle like the gems 
of Golconda. She has been taught humility 
and obedience, and has never conversed 






63 



"With any man, except her father and her 
brother. I know so urell the tenderness and 
extreme lenity of thy disposition, that it is 
necessary to caution thee against extreme 
indulgence, and to put thee in mind of the 
words of the sacred Shastra,* which sayeth» 
* that a man both day and night must keep 
his wife so much in subjection, that she by 
no means be mistress of her own actions. 
If she have her own free will, notwithstand- 
ing her having sprung from a superiour Cast, 
she will nevertheless act amiss.' 

If thou art inclined to dismiss the spirit 
of delusion, and listen to the voice of thy 
friend, I will meet thee, not at Ferrockabad, 
bat at Rampore ; as though the interest of 
certain friends I have some hopes given me

the eye of kindness, and probably restore 
me to the possession of my fathers. I have

LETTER IV. 



I%e Bramm Sheemnal to Elsbean Neivj 



The letter of the noble and IllaBtrious 
Rigah I have read vith the most profound 
respect ; and at thj request shall hasten to 
remove from his eyes the film •f prejudice, 
and to convince him that the opinions he 
has conceived, concerning the Christians 
of England, are altogether false and erro- 
neous. I do not TTonder, that the enlight- 
ened mind of the noble Rayah should have 
conceived a predilection in favour of a 
people nvho seem destined to make so con- 
spicuous a figure in the annals of Asia. 
Aa a race of brave and daring mortals, 
chosen ^ by Veeshnii to curb the fury of 
destructive tyranny, to blunt the sword of 



68 



the destroyer, and break the galling fet- 
ters of the oppressed, I, and every Hm- 
doo, must unite with him in pronouncing 
their eulogium: but as to the principles 
which actuate their conduct, their religion, 
their laws, and their manners, the miod 
of the noble Rajah has been immersed in 
error. 

The learned Pundit, whose fame has 
extended from the walls of Lucknoo to the 
banks of Barampooter,* had sufficiently 
opened my understanding. It became evi- 
dent, that whatever was in any degree ex- 
cellent or admirable, throughout the Bobor 
Logue,t was an emanation from the shadow 
of wisdom, a ray of light obliquely darting 
from the sacred volume which issued from 
the chambers of the deep.} To ascertain

have intimately conversed with Christians 
of all ranks and orders ; military command- 
ers, chiefs invested with the powers of civil 
authority, and men who made the study of 
literature their employment and delight, is 
it possible, I say, that I should never once 
have heard of such a l)ook ? Let the noble 
Rajah be the judge. 

That a book of ancient origin, vulgarly 
called the bible^ was once known to the En- 
glish, I have had certain informaticm : but 
far from containing doctrines of such a na- 
ture as the Rajah has announced, the first 
proof of genius which a young man gives to 
the world, upon his issuing from the schools, 
is to speak of it with a becoming degree of 
contempt. Indeed, to extirpate from society 
all regard for the pernicious doctrines it con- 
tains, has long been the primary object of 
attention to the enlightened philosophers of 
Europe. How much the book is detested 
by these sage philosophers, may easily be 
inferred, when I declare, that of the many 
philosophers I have met with, who had most 



n 



vehemently spoken and written against it» ( 
not one had contaminated himself by deign- / 
ing to examine its contents. One of these 
great men, a profound writer of history, has 
given to the world a work more voluminous 
than the Mahabbarat, more brilliant than 
the odes of Sancha, undertaken and accom* 
plished, as I was well assured, with the be- 
nevolent purpose of convincing hisTsountry- ' 
men of the superiority of the Mahommedan 
to the Christian faith. Whether these en- 
lightened men will ever really succeed in 
their intention of establishing the religion 
of Mahomet in England, is, however, in my 
opinion, rather doubtful. 

However alluring the doctrine of poly- 
gamy and the view of the Mahommedan 
Paradise may be to men of taste and senti- 
ment, there are some obstacles which, I ap- 
prehend, would, in the opinion of (he peo- 
ple, be insurmountable. The chief of these 
I take to be the prohibition of wine, the 
strict fast of Ramozin^ and> above all, the

iojunctioos* eoDcemiiig the tnatoient of 
slaves, which are so mild and gensroos, 
that the Ohristians of England who are con- 
eemed in the traffick of their fellow cr?8- 
tored (and who form a large and respectable 
part of the community) would never be 
brought to submit to its authority. 

From the delusive opinion entertained in 
the sublune mind of the Rajah» of the relig- 
ion of the Christians, he will, no doubt, be 
inclined to imagine, that their philanthropy 
embraces the wide circle of the human nee. 
How far the rule of ' doing to others as tbey i 
would be done by, in the like case^' actuates 
the Christians of England, may be learned 
from the following history of my voyage.

tieur seven hiradred people, governed by a 
few Chiefs, whose commands were obeyed 
with the quickness of the lightning^s glance, 
and the frown of whose displeasure was fol- 
lowed by the severity of punishment.^ We 
had made two thirds of our voyage to the 
coast of Britain, when a ship appeared at a 
distance, which our skilful mariners soon 
perceived to be in distress. I bad so often 
witnessed what I thought to be th^ exercise 
of cruelty during my abode in this sea-borne 
fortress, that I did not expect the distresses 
of people, whom they had never seen, would 
excite much of their compassion. In this, 
however, I was mistaken. To my astonish- 
ment, every effort was instantly made to 
afford relief to these strangers ; and I beheld 
the toil-strengthened nerves of these lions of 
the ocean strained by the most vigorous ex- 
ertions to save the almost sinking vessel. 
At length the object of their labours was 
effected ; and they, who bad been so zealous 
to save, now appeared perfectly Indifferent 
to the expressions of gratitude and admira-

Hon wblch were poured out by the people 
whom they bad so gallantly delivered from 
the jaws of deBtniclion. Our carpenter vas 
employed to repair the breaches in the un- 
fortunate vessel. And, as the weather was 
now ca1ro« curiosity led the principal people 
of our company to vi^it the ship of the strao* 
gers. I was among the number. But Ob! 
that I could obliterate from my mind the 
memory of a scene, the horrours of which no 
pen can describe, no tongue can utter, no 
imagination conceive. It was an English 
vessel, which had been on a voyage to the 
coast of Africa, from whence it was now 
proceeding to the British settlements in the 
West Indies, with a cargo, not of silver and 
gold, not of costly spires and rich perfumes, 
but of some hundreds of the most wretched 
of the human race ; a cargo of slaves. ^ These 
miserable beings were here huddled together 
in the squalid cells of a moving dungeon. 
Their uncouth screams, their dismal groans, 
their countenances, on which were alternate- 
ly depicted the images of fury, terrour* aad 



76 

despair* the claokiog of their chains, aod th^ 
savage looks of the white barbariaos who 
comaittaded them, exhibited such a scene 
as mucks description. 

Surely, the magnanimous Rajah will not 
imagine, that the jierpetrators of this cruelty 
could be the professors of a religion of mer* 
cy. No. Had a ray of knowledge enligbt« 
ened their understandings, through the taw- 
ny hue of the unlettered savage, they would 
have recognised the emanation of the ere* 
ating Spirit; they would have* perceived 
the kindred mind, which, in its progressive 
course through the stages of varied being, 
might one day inhabit the. bodies of th«k 
own offspring. For my part, when I con* 
templated the scene before me, [ anticipated, 
in imagination, the few swiftly rolling years, 
which might change the abode of the souls 
of these tyrant whites into the frames of 
woe-destined negroes; while the present 
victims of their cruelty would, in their turns, 
become the masters, and, seizing the scorpion 
whip of oppression, retaliate their present 



re 

•ufferingB with all the bitteroess of revenge. 
Bat, alas t the divine doctrine of retribution 
is unknown to these Christians. No dread 
of after pnnishment restrains the remorselesi 
hand of cruelty. No apprehension of the 
vengeance of an offended Deity diverts 
them from the greedy pursuits of avarice or 
dbturbs the enjoyments of luxury. For let 
it not stagger your faith in my veracity, 
when I inform you, that all this aggregate 
of human misery is incurred in order to pro- 
cure a luxurious repast to the pampered ap- 
petites of these voluptuaries, and that the 
unhappy negroes are torn from their countiy, 
their friends and families, for no other pu^ 
pose but to cultivate the sugar-cane ; a work 
of which the lazy Europeans are themseWes 
incapable* 

When I mention the slaves of Christians, 
let not your imagination turn to the bonds- 
men of Asia, as if their situations were pa- 
rallel. No. By the mild laws of our Shas- 
ter, and even by the less benevolent institu- 
tions of Mabommed, slaves are contidereil

pasts of the fayoured of Veeshnii receive 
their highest relish. 

But my obserrations on the religion of 
the people of England stop not here. * To 
obtain complete information apon this sub- 
ject, was the object I kept perpetually in my 
view. And I hope it is known to the Ra- 
jah, that a Bramin of my character is not 
easily to be deceived. The custom of de- 
dicating the seventh day to acts of piety 
and devotion, is mentioned by the Rajah as 
an institution admirably calculated for keep- 
ing up the spirit of a religion, which was in- 
tended for the purification of the heart, and 
of which the duties of penitence and self-ex- 
amination formed constituent parts. Alas t 
how grossly has his simplicity been imposed 
upon. It is indeed observed as a bolidaf 
by the lower Casts, and spent by some of 
the industrious orders of mechanicks iq tbci 
innocent amusement of walking in the fields^ 
accompanied by their wives and children. 



79 

By thofe of Tess iober maimers, it Is em- 
plojed in the indulgence of giattony «nd 
the most depraved intemperance. By the 
higher Casts, it is altogether unobserved, 
except as a day particularly propitious to 
the' purpose of travelling. A select numlier, 
from all the different Casts, occasionally 
amuse themselves by attending, for an hour 
or two, on the mornings of that day, at cer- 
tain large buildings, called Churches; a 
practice which they doubtless continue in 
conformity to some ancient custom, the 
origin of which is now forgotten^ though the 
practice continues to be partially observed. 
Curiosity once led me into one of these 
churches, where a young man dressed in 
white l)egan the performance of the ceremo- 
ny. Had it not been for the carelessness 
of bis manner, I should have been tempted 
to believe that he was engaged in offering 
prayers to the Deity ; and so far as the extreme 
rapidity of his utterance would permit me to 
judge, some things he said so plainly alluded 
to a future state of existence, that one, less 



80 

tralj infeniied tlwD I was, nlgbl btve be^i 
led into s belief that soine micb Dotions bad 
actually been entertaiDed among tbem. Tbe 
eeremoDies of this day were concluded by as 
elderiy priest, in a black robe, who read, in 
a langnid and monotonoas tone, from a small 
book, wbicb be held in his hand, a sort of 
exhortation; the truths contained in whicli 
seemed equally tndiflerent to himself and to 
bis audience. Nor did the little attention 
that was paid to his discourse seem to give 
him any offence, or to impel him to speak in 
a more energetick manner ; though it proba- 
bly hastened his conclusion; at which he 
had no sooner arrived, than the countenancea 
of his auditors brightened, and they congra- 
tulated one another on their being eman- 
cipated from the fatigue of this tiresome 
ceremony. 

Had I never penetrated farther into the 
character of these Christians, I should have 
considered them as beings altogether inca- 
pable of a serious and profound attention to 
the performance of any religious duty; but 



81 



a deeper investigation conTinced me of the 
contraryt and that in the performance of 
of such ceremonies as they deemed ^ real 
importance^ these trifling people could evince 
a degree of assiduity and perseverance that 
Tffould have done honour to a Sanee assee.* 

The rites to which f allude, may, in my 
opinion, easily be traced to the sacred in« 
atitutions of the beloved of Brahma ; the na* 
tion which is the pure fountain of all human 
vrisdom. 

To the intelligent mind of the noble 
Bfyah, it is well known how our great 
ancestors, incomparahle in wisdom, ordained 
such mystical representations of the superi- 
our intelligences, as it is not JHwful for any 
but the most holy and learned of the Bra- 
mins to explore. The most pious of the

worldly thoughts by years of abstinence,

much application and unwearied study, en- 
abled to perceive the true meaning of those 
representations hewn in the stupendous rock, 
or carved in the lofty walls of ancient edi- 
fices, which, to the eyes (if the vulgar, ap- 
pear uncouth images of stone. And it is 
doubtless from this wise example of our an* 
eient Bramins, that the priests of all religions 
have learned the art of concealing the sim- 
plicity of truth under the dark and impenetra- 
ble cloud of symbolical mystery, which none 
but they themselves can fully explain. The 
knowledge of the vulgar is the death of zeal : 
But deep is the reverence of ignorance. 

It was not, then, from the people engaged 
In the rites I mention, that I could expect 
information concerning them : but I bad a 
better instructor in the depth of my own sa- 
gacity, which ^oon taught me, that the ob- 
ject of their most serious devotion was strict- 
ly analogous to the symbols of our Dewtah, 



63 



not indeed cut in the solid rock of gloomy ca- 
Terns* not hewn on the walls of sacred tem- 
ples ,' but, correspondent to the trifling genius 
of these silly people, painted upon small slips 
of stiff paper! Neither is the manner in 
which these devotions are performed exactly 
similar to ours. It is not necessary that those 
devotees should perform the seven ak>lntion8; 
neither do4hey rub their bodies with earth { 
neither do they cover their heads with cow- 
dung : and, instead of solemn prostration be- 
fore these painted objects of their idolatry ' 
they take them familiarly into their hands^ 
and tosB them one after another upon a table 
covered with green cloth ; turn them up ^nd 
down, sometimes gaxing upon them with 
momentary admiration, as they lie prostrate 
on the middle of the table; then again, seis- 
ing them with holy anlour, they turn them 
hastily upon their faces. And to this Poojali^ 
of idols, termed cards, do the major part of 
the people devote their time; sacrificing

eveiy eiuoynwnt of life, as well as eveiy 
domestick duty, to the performance of thil 
singular devotion. 

It b said) that it is incumbent only on a 
 professed hermit utterly to renounce his 
passions and worldly pursuits : but that it is 
sufficient for a domestick character to refrain 
from their abuse.' The zeal for the Poojah 
of cards inspires a more exalted degree of 
self-denial : I have known it lead its ardent 
votaries to exclude the soul-enlivening rays 
of the golden sun, in the finest evenings of 
their short-lived summer; and while the Qight- 
gaie warbled its tale of love to the listening 
ruse, and all the beauties of nature glowed 
around them, I have beheld them turn from 
the temptation with heroick firmness, and 
placing themselves at the altars of their idols 
remain immoveably fixed in that devotion, 
which absorbed the powers of their soul. 

Little as I am inclined to coincide with 
the opinion of the Rajah, relative to the 
superiority of the femnlfrs of Europe in any 
other particular, i must confess, that in their 



B5 

unwearied asBiduity to the Poojah of cards, 
they evince a degree of constancy scarcely 
exceeded by a pious Togee* in the act of 
penance. 

The languor, do visible in the counte- 
nances of the people assembled in the church, 
was never to he observed during the per- 
formance of this more important ceremony. 
Here, even the very Priest lost the apathy 
which had there soi strongly marked his 
Countenance. The attention of his fellow 
worshippers was no longer a matter of in- 
difference to him. His zeal was kindled 
into fervour, and broke forth into the severity 
of reproach against a female who sat oppo- 
site to him, for exhibiting some transient 
mark of negligence in the performance of the 
duty in which she was now engaged.

rigorous performance of the peoitential duties, esteemed 
by the Hindoos so essentially necessary toward the ad-

frequently so severe as to excite an equal degree of aston- 
ishment and horrour.

UniYersally as the Poqjah of cards is c»- 

tablished throughout the country, it has not^ 

in the remotest provinces* been able entirelj 

to supersede another species of idolatry^ 

which has clearly and indisputably beea 

lK>rrowed from the manners of their eastern 

progenitors. This is no other than the wor* 

ship of certain birds and quadrupeds, which 

are held so sacred by their worshippers, tbi^ 

the preservation of their lives occupies, I am 

well assured, many volumes of their lawa, 

and has employed the chief study of their 

sapient Legislators. I should have wished 

to obtain much ioforniation upon a subject 

so curious ; but all that I could learn, was, 

that the provincial Rajahs, devoted to *tbe 

worship of these animals, are mostly sprung 

from the first Cast. (A certain proof of their 

Braminical origin.) They despise the vain 

pursuit of literature ; and conscious of their 

native and inherent superiority, they pique 

themselves upon their ignorance of all the 

sciences that are in esteem among the lower 

orders of men.

formation was not to be looked for: but 
a eircnmstauce which occured while I jour- 
neyed over the remote parts of the kingdom, 
threw sufficient light upon the subject. 

In one particular, however, the higher 
Casts in that country must be acknowledged 
to dififer widely from the race of Brahma.— 
They are deficient in hospitality ! Never did 
I see the doors of a great man open to receive 
the wearied traveller : the milk of his cows' 
flows not into the stranger's dish. Nay, so 
Tery rude and inhospitable are the manners 
of the people of high Cast, that once upon 
a time, when, being overtaken by darkness 
in a rainy evening, I attempted to procure 
lodgings for myself and my attendant, at the 
house of one of these provincial Rajahs, which 
was situate near the road, I was not only 
denied admittance, but repulsed with the 
language of contempt, and necessitated td 
continue my route, in a dark and stormy 
evening, till the sight of a peasant's hut 
cheered my heart with the hope of shelter. I 
was not disappointed ; for in this country the 



88 

spirit of hospitality u only to be found be- 
nealh a roof of thatcb. The decent matron* 
^ho iobabited this lowly but, received me 
with looks of cordial welcome. Five bloom- 
ing children surrouuded Ibe blazing fiie, 
whose cheerful light was reflected from the 
bright utensils that adorned the white wash- 
ed walls. My first appearance dismayed the 
little train, but some candied sweetmeats, 
with which I presented them, quickly recon- 
ciled them to my complexion. The genii» 
who delight to revel in the troubled air, 
howled around this humble dwelling, and 
pouring the dashing torrent from the black- 
bosomed clouds ol night, they heard with 
joy the thuuder's roar while nimbly fol- 
lowing the lightning's flash, they exulted 
in the mingled tempest. The pale hue of 
terrour sat upon the matron's cheek: she 
listened, with anxiety and impatience, for 
the voices of ber husband and her son, who 
were not yet returned from the labours of the 
day: and while her own fears increased with 
the horrours of the tempest, she employed 



henelf in appeasing those of the infant group^ 
who clang to her, demanding, with accents 
of clamorous sorrow, the return of their fa- 
ther and their brother. 

When the storm a little abated of its irio* 
knee, the little creatures ran by turns to the 
door, eagerly peeping into the dark abyss of 
night, in hopes of discovering their approach. 
The anxious mother added fuel to the a)- 
ready blazing fire ; again she swept the un- 
scHled hearth ; and again adjusted the chairs> 
which had long been placed for the reception 
of the supporters of her hope. At length, 
the well known steps were heard; every 
heart fluttered with joy, and every little 
hand was stretched out, eager to receive the 
paternal and fraternal embrace. The old 
man and his son were for some time occupi* 
ed in returning the caresses of their family ; 
which they did with the tenderness of atTec* 
tion : and then the venerable master of this 
humbled abode came forward to welcome me 
to a share of the comforts it afforded. He 
had looked at me earnestly for some time, 

VOL. I. 8 * 



90 



when, to my utter astonishmenf, he addreM- 
ed me in mj native language. The Mhort 
he spoke was but indifferent, but it was in- 
tellipble, and more charming to my ears 
than the musick of the seven genii. 

In order to account for what appeared to 
me such an extraordinary phenomenon, he 
told roe that, in early life, he had been tempt- 
ed, by the God of Love, to win the affec- 
tions of a damsel, whose beauty bad touched 
the heart of the village Lord. The place of 
wife, in the establishment of this great man» 
was already occupied by the daughter of a 
neighbouring Rajah; but he had probably 
been convinced, by the philosophers, of the 
propriety of the system of Mahommet; and 
thought that the damsel, though the daugh- 
ter of a mechanick, would be no unworthy 
ornament of bis zenana. It is not to be won- 
dered at that he should be filled with indig- 
nation at the presumption of the young pea- 
sant, who dared to interfere with his plea- 
sures, and disappoint his schemes, by marry- 
ing the object of his hopes. It is not pro- 



91 

per that inferiours should bif'permitted to de- 
feat the intentions of their Lords with impor 
nity. This great man was of the same opi- 
nion ; and, in the height of his resentment 
against his successful rival, he had him torn 
from the arms of his bride, and sent in a com- 
pany of soldiers, who were all collected in 
the same arbitrary manner (probably as a 
panisbment for the same sort of offence) to 
the East Indies. Here this unfortunate 
martyr to love spent eleven years in the ser- 
vice of the Company, in the rank of a petty 
officer : when having, by his economy, saved 
a sum sufficient for the purposes of humble 
competence, he obtained leaVe to return to 
bis native country. As the gay pennant, 
though forced to obey the pressure of the 
changeful breeze, still clings to its beloved 
mast, and, at the return of every short-lived 
calm, flutters round the object to which it 
was in youth united ; so the heart of this 
honest peasant, in all the storms of fortune, 
hovered round the cottage that contained his 
wife and child. At length, her obscure re- 



92 

tirement was Maddened by his presenee. 
By the employment of her needle, she had 
procured, during his absence, an honourable 
and virtuous subsistence for herself and son* 
The little fortune be had brought from India 
was, lost by the villafny of the agent into 
whose- hands he had entrusted it But in 
the endearments of mutual affection, this 
honest couple had a fund of felicity, which 
the malice of fortune could not destroy. 
Both the good man and his son found em- 
ployment for their industry in cutting down 
the trees of a neighbouring wood : a work 
which had been committed to their care, 
and amply recompensed their diligence. 
When they returned from their labour, the 
cheerful appearance of the well-ordered fami- 
ly at home, the smiling welcome of the lit- 
tle innocents, and the affectionate tenderness 
of the worthy matron, presented to them a 
reward which went farther than the gifts of 
fortune have power to penetrate : — it reach- 
ed the heart. 



98 

The recital of these cirevmstances was 
made to me daring the most cheerful repast 
that I ever saw Christians partake of. When 
it was ended, a ceremony ensued, which hav- 
ing never seen practised at any other period, 
I have reason to think peculiar to themselves. 
Upon a hint from the old soldier, hift eldf'st 
daughter presented him with a very large 
book, from which, with a clear and solemn 
voice, he read some admirable instructions 
and exhortations. The sublime and com- 
nandiog energy with which these precepts 
were expressed, might lead to a conclusioni^ 
that this was a copy of the same Shaster 
with which the departed Saib Percy present- 
ed the learned Rajah: but many obstacles 
oppose themselves to this supposition. Could 
we believe that a book of such distinguished 
BQtbority, unheard of among the learned 
and totally unknown among the superiour 
Casts, should yet be found familiar in the 
cottage of a peasant? It is too absurd for 
the shadow of probability to rest upon. 



94 

But to return to the religious rites of these 
simple people ; ^hich, as I have observed^ 
differ essentially from all that had hitherto 
come vrithin my observation : for instead of 
the Poojah of cards, which at that hour 
would have been performed in the families 
of the higher Casts, when the old man had 
shut the book, he knelt down, his wife and 
blooming Infants following his example. 
The latter clasped their little hands and 
held them up to heaven, while he lifted up 
bis voice, calling upon the unseen, omnis- 
cient, and immortal Preserver, to bless them, 
and to accept from hearts of gratitude the 
offering of praise and thankfulness. I can- 
not account for it, but there was something 
in this whole ceremony which greatly affect- 
ed my mind ; and 1 could not help, while I 
listened to the simple but fervent devotion 
of this virtuous labourer, feeling for bim a 
degree of veneration, even superiour to what 
I had experienced for the Priest, whose 
zeal had been so conspicuous at the Poojah 
of cards. 



95 



In tbe moraine, the same rites were ngt^xa 
repeated; after \vhich, I look leave of. thit 
innocent and happy family; the old man 
insisting that, as I had come some miles out 
of my way, his son should accompany me to 
the village where I had directed my servant 
and horse to meet me. The lad willingly 
obeyed the commands of his father, and we 
set out together. He was a handsome youth, 
of about twenty years of age, and of a sensi* 
ble and intelligent countenance. Taking a 
path through a corn 6eld, it being qow tbe 
latter end of harvest, we met a young pea« 
tant, who carried a gun, which he frequently 
fired to frighten the crows and other/ birds 
from the grain. My companion took the 
weapon of destruction into his hand to exa- 
mine it : and in that unhappy moment, in 
which the Goddess of Mischance presided, a 
group of partridges appeared before him : 
be involuntarily struck the flint ; the report 
resounded through the air, and oh ! unfor- 
tunate destiny, seven of these sacred birds 
; ^ere laid rolling in the dust. He had no 



96 



time to consider of the fatal deed ; for, in a 
moment, two men, vrhom the bushes had 
concealed from oar view, darted on the 
gniity youth, wrested the weapon of destruc- 
tion from his trembling hand, and, with 
many imprecations of vengeance, insisted 
upon his immediately attending them before 
the awful tribunal of assembled Magistrates, 
who were now exercising the sacred func- 
tions of their office in the neighbouring vil- 
lage. It was then I learned the real magni- 
tude of my friencrs offence. For I was then 
informed, that to preserve these sacred 
birds from being injured by the unhallowed 
hands of any of the lower Cast, the severest 
laws were promulgated : and as the Zimeen- 
dars in the office of the magistracy, before 
whom these offences were tried, were all of 
them worshippers of the rural Dewtab, they 
never suffered the stern sentence of justice 
to be softened at the suggestion of mercy. 

As it is not good to forsake a friend in his 
adversity, we entered the temple of justice 
together. In this awful tribunal, seated in 



9? 



two large chairs, we found tbe offended Ma^ 
gistrates. The first of these judges seemed 
fully conscious of his dignity, which was in- 
deed very great, uniting in himself tbe triple 
offices of Priest, Zimeendar, and Magistrate 
of the place. The other ws a Pundit, 
learned in the law; called, in the language 
of these people, an attorney. No sooner 
did the witnesses of my friend^s guilty deed 
present the unhappy culprit bcifore them, 
producing at the same time the murdered 
birds and the destructive engine of their 
dissolution, than the murmur of indignation 
arose ; the cause in which they were then 
hearing evidence was instantly disVnissed : 
it was, indeed, only concerning a man who 
was said to have beaten his wife almost to 
death : a trifling crime, in the eyes of these 
Magistrates, when compared to the murder 
of seven partridges ! 

Tbe son of the soldier attempted to speak 
in his own defence, but was prevented by 
tbe first judge, who declared that the proof 
was sufficient for his condemnation, and 

TOL. I. 9 



98 

that he never would bear any thing in fa- 
vour of A POACHER : (a name given by thia 
sect to the enemies of their idolatry.) From 
the to^ne of wrath with Which he pronounced 
these words, I saw that the young man's fate 
was determined ; and when, after some con- 
sultation between themselves, the younger 
judge arose to pronounce his sentence, I ex* 
pected, with sorrow, to have heard the irrevo- 
cable mandate of immediate death; and 
knowing how vindictive the priests of all re. 
liginos usually are toward those who have 
treated with contempt the objects of their su- 
perstitious veneration,! should have been well 
pleased to have compounded for. his simple 
death, unattended by the tortures which I 
feared might be inflicted on him, for a crime 
which, I plainly saw, was thought of by his 
judges with horrour. Judge then what a 
mixture of astonishment and delight, I heard 
the mild and merciful sentence uttered by 
the Pundit, which pronounced no other sen* 
ience of punishment, but that of paying a 
sum of money I 



99 

How vnivenal is the sin of ingratitude ? 
When I expected to behold this young man 
embracing the feet of his merciful judges 
with grateful rapture, I heard him, with as- 
tonishment, venture to expostulate with his 
benefactors upon his utter inability to pay so 
great a fine. He mentioned the situation of 
his parents ; said they defiended upon his 
labour for support ; and that, should his 
judges persevere in inflicting the payment 
of so large a sum upon him, it must deprive 
them of his assistance ; or, by robbing them 
of the little savings of their industry, reduce 
their young ones to penury, and cause them 
to eat the bread of bitterness in their old 
age. * Let pity for my aged (larents induce 
you to soften the rigour of ray sentence,* 
cried the ungrateful youth, *and, though a 
thousand partridges were to start up before 
me, I swear I shall never injure one feather 
of their wings.' Alas! his eloquence was 
lost. The judges remained inexorable : till 
at length, being touched with the sorrow of 
the young man, I resolved to address them in 



599416A 



leo 

the best Eoglish I was master of. * Mild, 
U|)r]gbt, and merciful judges,' cried I, ^ be- 
lieve not that 1 speak to excuse tbe crime 
of \vhicb tbis joung man bas been guilty. 
No. I have ever been taugbt to pay re- 
spect to the Dewtabs of vrbatever country I 
was in. With tbe Persick Magi i have 
bent in solemn adoration of tbe solar orb ; 
while, with other equally enlightened na- 
tions of tbe east, 1 have demonstra^d my 
respect for the crocodile, tbe jackall, and the 
monkey. Since fate bas brought me into 
this renowned kingdom, 1 have, in tbe great 
capital, attended, with due solemnity, tbe 
Poojah of cards : and now, that 1 am made 
acquainted with tbe religion of the Rajahs 
of tlie provinces, 1 judge of your feelings, 
most venerable Magistrates, upon the pre- 
sent occasion, by what my own would have 
been, had any base-born Sooder dared to 
lift bis impious bands against one of the sa- 
cred cows, who range the flowery meads of 
Burrampooter. But since, in tbe overflowr- 
ipg of your clemency, you have coodesceod 



101 

ed to limtt the deserved puniBbmeUt of this 
audacious youth to the paymeot of a fine, 1 
hope you will exteud the shadow of your 
goodness so far, as to accept the money from 
a stranger.' They stared at one another, 
astonished, no doubt, at the boldness of my 
speech ; but, nevertheless, were so kind as 
graciously to accept of the gold I offered 
them, and to suffer my companion to depart 
with me in peace. ^-^ 

After giving him some good advice against 
meddling, in future, with the Dewtah of the 
country, and presenting him with some 
pieces of gold for his family, I dismissed 
him, and proceeded on my journey. 

In the course of this tour, I had the cour- 
age to penetrate Into the northern regions of 
this united kingdom of Britain, where moun- 
tains, more stupendous than those of Upper 
Tartary, heave their bare brown backs to 
the merciless arrows of the keen-edged wind: 
where the bright-faced luminary of heaven 
Is wrapt in the eternal veil of clouds and 
storms ; but where, In the uucultivated bosom 

TOL I. 9* 



102 

of heatl^coFered detarts, resides a people 
whose origin is more ancieot than the 
'ocks whose gloomy summits overhang their 
dwellings. 

It was with a view of gaining some infor- 
mation in regard to the chronology of this 
ancient nation, that I was induced to visit it 
I had heard that the original Casts into 
which these, as well as other nations, had 
been divided at their creation, were here 
preserved in their original purity and per- 
fection. For this is another particular, in 
which the Riyah of Almorah has heen gross* 
ly deceived or misinformed. Instead of 
being all of one Cast, as he imagines, the 
people throughout Great Britain are divided 
into three Casts, all seperate, and distinct ' 
from each other; and which are commonly 
known by the several appellations of people 

OF FAMILY, PEOPLE OF NO FAMILY, and 

PEOPLE OF STYLE, or fashiou. The first 
two are of much more ancient origin than 
the other Cast; which, indeed, appears to 
have sprung from an unnatural mixture of 



103 

the others ; like the trides of* Buhran Sunk- 
er, in Hiodostaii. But M^hat is extraordina- 
ry, and entirely peculiar to the Cast of peih 
pl€ rfstyle^ is, that adoiissioa may be obtain- 
ed by those who were not born in it, nay, 
who have 'sprung from the lowest of the tribe, 
called PEOPLE of no family; and these 
people, thus admitted, I have ever observed 
to be most tenacious of the rights and privi- 
leges of their new Oast, treating those who 
still remain in that which they have left with 
the utmost contempt, breaking ^ff all con- 
nexion with them, and frequently denying 
(particularly in the presence of other people 
of fashion) that they ever had any acquaio- 
tance with them: an asseveration always 
made with peculiar warmth, when these 
newly made people of fashion are known to 
be under any particular obligations to the 
PEOPLE OF NO FAMILY. The mode of in- 
itiation into this Cast, I suppose to be made 
by the ceremonies of ablution : and certain 

• See Qentoo Lawi, page 43.

•treamt and tpringS) of mysterious efficacy, 
are to be foonU in varioos parts of the king* 
dom ; where I have reason to think the cere- 
monies of initiation are usually performed. 
A resort to these springs, called watering- 
places, at certain seasons of the year, being 
prescribed to people efstyUy and all the can* 
didates for that Cast, as an indispensible 
duty. 

Among these candidates, the most certain 
method of procuring success, is an assiduous 
devotion to the Poojah of cards: liberal 
offerings of gold, at the altars of these little 
painted idols, having frequently procured the 
honours of initiation, to the most low-bom» 
low-bred, and illiterate personages in the 
community. The flood of wealth, which 
the golden stream of commerce has diffused 
over the kingdom of England, has greatly 
contributed to the exaltation of this upstart 
tribe : but in the northern kingdom, which la 
now blended with it (as Bahar b with Orissa) 
the barrier between pet^le of family and peo- 
ple ofnofamih/^ has been too strong fo^ the 



105 

tide of wealth to break, too powerful for the 
teeth of time to destroy, i w^» exirt*mely 
aoxioufl to gain an insight into the chrono- 
logical annals of this most ancient nation, 
but could obtain none that was any wise sa- 
tisfactory. By a strange custom, the culti- 
vation of letters is confined to the people of 
no family^ who are at no paius to trace the 
origin of the first Oast beyond that of their 
own ; but by my own ol)servation, confirm- 
ed by the hints I received from all the peo^ 
fie of family with .whom 1 conversed; ir it 
evident that a period- of many thousand yean 
must have elasped between the creation of 
the two Casts. Indeed, to believe that the ve- 
nerable and exalted cast of people of family 
should have sprung from one common parent 
with the people of no fanuly, is equally ab- 
surd as to suppose, that in the revolution of 
the few years that are doomed to terminate a 
transient and uncertain existence they should 
moulder into the same sort of dust 1 Base 
slander on the inherent superiority of birth ! 
Thfl^ minds of the people of family are filled 



IM 

with too jast fto idea of their own dignity to 
admit so injurious a supposition. Conscious 
of the blessing of soperiour origin, the an- 
cient Rajahs, and all who can boast a portion 
of their blood, never fail to express a proper 
degree of coo tempt for the people of inferionr 
Cast ; nor can the possession of talents, the 
attainments of science, or the exercise of the 
^blimest virtue, serve, in any degree, in 
their eyes, to lessen the Invincible barrier 
that divides them. 

Together with the caltivation of letters, 
the exercise of the Priestly fonction is usual- 
ly confined to the second Cast. These men 
are more distinguished for the regularity of 
their lives, and sanctity of their deportment, 
tlian for their dexterity at the Poojah of 
cards, which in the southern part of ths king- 
dom is so essential a requisite in the duty of 
a priest. The ceremonies of their religion 
are somewhat similar to those of the cotta- 
ger; they are no strangers to the duties of 
hospitality, and recommend the enlightening 
study of literature both by their precept and 



107 

example. Iq all other respectsi the cliarac* 
terktick virtaes aod peculiar customs of this 
natioo, are so eyidently of Hindoo origin, 
that DOthing but the most wilful blindness 
could make any one assert the contrary. 

As the illustrious Rajahs of Hindostaa 
when sitting in the midst of their wide-ex- 
tended possessions, forgot not to bend before 
the Bramin, whos to procure nourishment for 
his familyi Uboureth in his garden, in like 
manner the people of whom I speak, retain 
the dignity of their Cast, even when com- 
pelled by poverty to exercise any trade in 
order to procure a livelihood : and as in In- 
dia members of the tribe of Brahma are fre- 
quently found exercising the employments of 
commerce aod agriculture, so in this ancient 
nation do people of family often condescend 
to become weavers, shoemakers, and barbers, 
without forfeiting Cast, or in the least abat- 
ing of the liigh idea of their own inherent 
superiority. It is not so with the people of 
styUy who by entering into any of these em- 
ployments lose all the privileges of their 



€ast; a elreimstaiice which occasions fioiii* 
hefB of the poorer branches of that tribe to 
Gve in a humiiiatiDg state of dependence 
npcm the richer, rather submitting to any in- 
dignity than run the risk of lositig Cast bj 
snbniittinir to work for their oi^n sabsistence. 
The mode of living among these people, 
in which animal food is scarcely known, is 
another argument in favour of their Hindoo 
origin. Much mieht Iike\ii8e he said of the 
similarity of raund l>etwpen Laird and Rajab; 
a similarity, which, in the opinion of learned 
antiquarians, is more than sufficient to estab- 
lish an etymology. Nor is this alt ; like us, 
they consider themselves a distinct and /(^ 
wmred people y superioor to the rest of tbe in- 
habitants of tbe earth, and do not fail to 
maintain, that whatever instances of cour- 
age, magnanimity, or heroick virtue, are dis- 
playeti by any inhabitant of the other nations 
of tbe world, would, in similar circumstances, 
have been far exceeded by one of their ovrn 
countryman. 



109 

These highly favoured p#ople being too 
lenacioufl of their dignity to admit strangers 
(with whose pedigree they are anacquainted) 
into the honour of their society ; the person 
to whom I was chiefly indebted for informa, 
tion was the lady, at whose house I lodged. 
She was of the peapU affamb/ Cast, sprung 
from an illustrious race; her fifteenth grand- 
father had been a mountain Rajah ; and, id 
the ramifications of his blood, she could 
boast a degree of affinity to one-and-twenty 
Lairds ! She was forced, by the dictates ot 
necessity, to make up articles of female attire 
for her maintenance, but never worked, as 
she herself assured me, for any but people of 
her or0n Cast ; and I was induced to believe 
her, from the marked contempt with which I 
observed her treat all who bad the misfortune 
to be born people of no family. This was 
particularly felt by a young woman of beauti- 
ful person, gentle manners, and good educa- 
tion, whom this high-born female, being 
equally ignorant of orthography and arith- 
metick, was under the necessity of employ- 

▼OL. I. 10 



no 

ing as an assiBtant ia her bosineBS : and ^hose 
conversation, had it not been for the differ- 
ence of the Casts from which they sprung, 
I should have greatly preferred to that of her 
mistress; but the cousin of one-and-twenty 
mountain Rajahs had too just a claim to my 
veneration, to be put in competition with 
the paltry advantages of youth, beauty, ta- 
lents, and understanding ! 

It was in this house I observed, with 
pleasure, the practice of that admirable de- 
gree of abstemiousness, the reverse of which 
had, in the southern part of the island, so fre- 
quently excited the fee/ings of faorrour and 
disgust. The servants of this illustrious Bib- 
by did not sit down together to excite one 
another to acts of gluttony and intempe- 
rance : but after long and rigorous abstinence, 
they snatched the scanty morsel of simple 
viands which their prudent mistress had 
allotted for them; nor, even at her own 
table, did I ever see a meal displayed, of 
which the most holy Pakeer might not have 
partaken without breaking his vows of self- 
denibl!

'^' Thus hath thy servant clearly refuted two 
f of the propositions of the misguided Rajah . 
' ^and proved, in the most satisfactory manner, 
'- and from the most undoubted authority, that 
if such a Shaster as he speaks of ever did 
^ exists it is now become altogether obsolete 
and entirely unknown; that the only devo- 
tion known to the majority of the community» 
is the Poojah of cards, and Partridges ; and 
that the people of Great Britain are, at this 
day, divided into separate Casts, as distinct 
from each other as the Bramin from the 
Kettrie. 
a There are other errours into which the 
y. noble Rajah has suffered his mind to be led, 
which I could with equal ease refute, did I 
not know how easily the mind of a great 
man is disgusted by prolixity. 
What can I say more !

Vrom tlu Braraifi tB Maftnda

XitT the cominandt of Maandaara be obey- 
ed. In the plenitude of my desire to open 
the eyes of yoar misgaided friend, I basten 
to proceed to a more partienlar descriJptiofi 
of the education and manners of the females 
of England; which the illastnons Rajah 
lias 80 erroneously conceived to be In some 
measure influenced by the doctrines of that 
obsolete Shaster, which seems to exalt the 
dignity of the female mind to an equality 
with that of the lords of the creation. 

I shall begin with an account of the usual 
mode of conducting the education of females 
in England. How far that is of a nature 
calculated for * lighting the torch of reason 



113 

and expanding the germ of intellect,' let the 
wisdom of the Rajah decide ! 

During the period of infancy these Chris- 
tian females (whose souls are, in the erring 
mind of Zaarrailla, deemed so precious) are 
permitted to receive their first ideas from 
m^cenary attendants, always ignorant, and 
frequently vicious. When the rising plant 
puts forth the tendrils of curiosity, which 
may at pleasure be directed to the tree of 
knowledge, or suffered to twine round the 
hollow bamboo of prejudice and folly : at 
that period, lest from the conversation of 
fathers or brothers these young females 
might, peradventure, acquire some degree of 
information, they are removed from the pos- 
sibility of. such deplorable consequences, and 
placed where science, reason, and common 
sense, dare not to intrude. In these Semi- 
naries, far from being treated as * beings, 
whose intellectual faculties are capable of 
progressive improvement through the ages 
of eternity,' their time is solely employed 
in learning a few tricks, sqch as a monkey

their creator for the employment of their

apend the most precious years of life in run- 
ning their fingers over certain bits of wood, 
which are so contrived as to make a jingling 
sort of noise, pleasant enough when one is a 
little accustomed to it, but which, in the 
manner executed by them, very seldom 
equals what is every day to be heard from 
the itinerant musicians that practice in the 
streets ! 

Another ingenious contrivance for ^IHng 
up that portion of time, which the friend of 
Maandaara supposes to be employed in the 
acquisition of useful knowledge, is, by the 
assistance of a master (whose attendance is 
paid for at a vast expense) making wretched 
imitations^of trees^ and flowers, and this is 
called learning to paint! It appears as if 
great care was taken to avoid the possibilitjr 



115 

•f the fenaie pupils ever arriving at any 
degree of perfection in tftie art, as I am well- 
informed that not one in five hundred is 
ever capable of copying from nature, or of 
doing any thing, when left 4b herself, that is 
not many degrees inferiour to the little 
pictures which may be purchased for the 
value of a rupee. 

Another indispensible part in the educa- 
tion of females of every Cast, of every rank, 
and in every situation, is the knowledge of 
the language spoken in their neighbouring 
nation. 1 was for some time at a great loss 
to know what reason could be assigned for 
so strange a custom, and after many conjec- 
tures, I rested in the belief, that as the 
French nation was frequently at war with 
tlie English, it might either be customary 
to send the women as Bircarrahs* into the 
caaip of the enemy, or, in case of defeat, to 
employ them in procuring terms of peace, 
which from the remarkable complaisance of 



116 

their adFefsaries to the female sez^ it m^ht 
be Bopposed, woald be negociated by the 
Bibbys with pecaliar advantage to their 
country. I was, however, forced to give up 
this conclusioiisjiMi being assured, that after 
yean spent in the study of the language, as 
it is taught at these excellent Seminaries^ 
few are capable of reading, and still fewer 
of conversing, with any degree of fluency 
in this tongue : and that the only real ad- 
vantage resulting from it was, that by what 
they knew of it, they were enabled to under- 
stand the peculiar terms belonging to the 
articles of dress imported from that country, 
which had an acknowledged right of impos- 
ing its fashions on the other nations of 
Europe. 

Dress is, indeed, one science in which full 
scope is given to the faculties of these fe- 
males : and the love of it, is, at the great 
Schools of the Christians, so successfully in- 
^ulcated, that it remains indelible to the 
latest period of life. Nor is the mode of 
education I speak of confined solely to the 



117 

children of the higher Casts, it extends to 
all, even to the daughters of tradesmen and 
mechanScks, who are employed, during the 
jears of improvement, exactly in the manner 
I have described. All the difference is, that 
at inferiour Schools, where inferionr masters 
are employed, the girls do not, perhaps, 
arriTe at the art of running their fingers over 
the l»ts of wood, called Keys of a Harps!** 
chord, with an equal degree of velooity; 
they make rather more execrable copies of 
more wretched pictures, and the knowledge 
ihey acquire of the French language does 
not, perhaps, enable them to run over the 
names of the new fashions with an equal de- 
gree of volubility; hut as to making any 
attempt at instructing the daughters of 
Christians, in any thing useful lo themselves 
or society, the idea would be deemed equally 
ridiculous in Seminaries of every class. 

So far all is right. We behold women 
moving in tlieir proper sphere, learning no 
otlier art, save that of adorning their persons; 
and inspired with no other view, but that 



11« 

of rendering themselvefl objects of pleasure 
Co the eyes of men. But bow shall I astoniBh 
you, when I unfold the extreme inconsisten- 
cy of the foolish Europeans, and inform you, 
that these uninstructed women are frequent- 
ly suffered to become entirely their own 
mistresses; sometimes entrusted with the 
management of large estates, and left at 
liberty to act for themselves ! Nay, that it 
is no uncommon thing for a man, who maji 
in other respects, by no means be consider- 
ed as a fool, to leave his children to the 
care of his widow, by which means I have 
frequently seen a little family cast upon the 
care, and depending for protection, on a 
poor, pretty^ helpless being, incapable of aoy 
idea, save that of dress, or of any duty, ex- 
cept tlie Poojah of cards ! How much wiser 
is the institution of Brahma, by which crea- 
tures, incapable of acting with propriety for 
themselves, are effectually put out of the 
way of mischief, by being burned with the 
bodies of their husbands. Wise regulations! 



119 

Laudable practice! by which the number 
of old women is so effectually diminished ! 

From what I have formerly said, you will 
observe, that women do actually sometimes 
carry on certain branches of trade; but to 
infer from this, that they are generally 
esteemed capable of business, or receive 
such an education as to enable them, if left 
destitute of the gifts of fortune, to enter into 
it, would be doing them great injustice. 
No, in that country, as well as in this, all 
men allow that there is nothing so amiable 
in a woman as the helplessness of mental t»t- 
hedlity ; and even the women themselves 
are so well convinced of this, that they* 
would consider it as an insult to be treated 
like rational creatures. The love of inde- 
pendence is, therefore, a masculine virtue, 
and though some few females are uncaniable 
enough to dare to enter upon some employ- 
ment for their support, this conduct is very 
much discouraged, and not only properly 
discountenanced by the men, but held in 
abhorrence by all women who entertain a 



ISO 

liroper Bente of (lie amiaUeiieM or fea»I« 
"weakneM. The females who belong to the 
CaitQr/M«!plrorj|ylf»are partieolarly seal- 
oi» in reprobating the exertions of female 
indostrj, and are »refnl to employ men 
only in all these branches in which fortune- 
less women have andaeionsly endeayooied to 
procure subsistence; for this reason* when 
a family, by any of those misfortunes occur- 
ring in a commercial country, happen to be 
reduced to poverty, the daughters of the 
family are either left a prey to gaunt-eyed 
indigence, or doomed to eat tho bitter bread 
of dependance, administered with sparing 
hand and grudging heart by some cold rela- 
tive ! Equally ignorant, and equally helpless^ 
as the females of Hindostan, their situation 
is far more destitute and pitiable. By the 
admirable institutions of our laws, it is o^ 
dained *• that a woman shall by no means 
be left to herself, but that, in case her near- 
est relations are incapable of taking care of 
her, that duty shall devolve upon the Ma- 



121 

gistratl.'^ Sat among the ChristianB of 
England they are as destitute of protection 
as of instruction. 

Tile fflisguider of the mind of Zaarmilla, 
bas, it must be confessed, mixed some trutli 
with the abundance of his falsehoods. When 
he told him, that it was customary in his 
country to teach women to read and write, 
he did not advance the thing which was 
not. It is true, that they are actually 
taught both, though for what purpose those 
keys of knowledge are put into their hands, 
it is not easy to imagine; few bad conse- 
quences, however, are found to result from 
this practice, as it is in general so wisely 
managed as to be very little prejudicial to 
the interests of ignorance; and is seldom 
employed for any other purpose than that of 
reading motly tales of love and murder, of 
which care is taken to furnish them with an 
abundant supply, from certain storehouses of 
trash, called circulating libraries.

TItt sjttem of female education, such ai 
I have i kacfibcd , is now almost onivenallj 
pnctiacd OTcr the island of Great Britain ; 
tbofl^ I have beard that, till lately, a sys- 
tem of a diffiefent nature was prevalent in 
the northern part of the united kingdom. 
There, instead of the Poojah of cards, it 
was then costomarj for the mothers of fami- 
lies to employ themseires in the education 
of their children, in teaching their daughters ^ 
the duties of domestick life, and in instilling 
into their tender minds the principles of 
piety and Yirtne. Beneath a mother's eye, 
the ypung females were then sent to certain 
places of instruction, called Day schools, 
accompanied by their brothers; a practice 
which would inevitably lay the foundation 
of a degree of fraternal affectioo, ioconsis- 
tent with that sort of reserved and austere 
demeanour, which it is so proper for men to 
oliserve toward their female relatives. Nor 
was this the only bad cocsequence resulting 
from the practice of sending boj's and girls 
to the same School. In the pure hearts of 



123 

tbe little iiinocen(8> altachments were often 
formed ; which, in the minds of the young 
females, excited such a wish to excel, in 
order to render themselves amiable in the 
eyes of their little friends, as was altogether 
incompatible with the preservation of igno- 
rance. Nor did the evil stop here; being 
habituated to consider their young school- 
fellows in the light of brothers, they had 
none of that restraint, which, before compa- 
ny, seals the lips of the Boarding-school 
Bibbys, but behaved with tbe frankness that 
id natural to the pure in heart. By early 
discipline, their minds received such an 
odious degree of firmness, aft often enabled 
them to sustain, with dignity, the most bit- 
ter decrees of adverse fortune, and their 
bodies acquired such a repulsive degree of 
health* as rende'red them equal to the dis- 
charge of every active duty. All these 
multifarious evils are now no longer to be 
apprehended ; the system of their southern 
neighbours is now, I am well assured, prac- 
tised vrith so much success, that tbe daugh- 



124 

ter of a nunaUain Rajah, will soon be at 
amiably frivolouB, as engagingly ignorant ; 
as weak in body and In mind, as the pupil of 
the greatest Boarding School in London. 

There are other instances in which these 
females of England, whom the infktuated 
Rajah has represented to himself * as exalt- 
ed in the scale of being to the rank of ra- 
tional, as capable of receiving the pure prin- 
ciples of virtue, and of steadily performing 
the various and complicated duties of life,' 
are treated in a manner at which the soul of 
humanity revolts. Thousands, and ten 
thousands, of these Cliristian women. Being 
yearly suffered to perish in the streets of 
their great metropolis, under the accumulat- 
ed misery of want, disease, and infamy ! 

We now think with horrour, of the blood- 
stained altars of the ancient groves, where, 
to appease the wrath of the black Goddess,* 

•Caliee, or the Black Goddess, is exhibited io thft 
iDdian temples with a collar composed of golden skulls, 
as descriptive of the dreadful sacrifices in which she took 
delight. The timid and benign character of the Hindooi, 



125 

it was permitted that human victims should 
be immolated : we paint to ourselves the 
agonizing feelings of the parent, when the 
blooming virgin was Jed forth, presenting a 
spotless offering to the sacrificial knife; and, 
sickening at the thought, we give praise to 
the adored Veeshnii, at whose commands 
these horrid rites were terminated. But 
callous and unfeeling Englishmen ! they en- 
dure to behold with their own eyes, sacri- 
fices in one year exceeding in number, all 
that, in the course of revolving years, perish- 
ed on the altars of Asia ! sacrifices, not im- 
molated to appease the wrath of their infer- 
nal Oewtahs, but victims of the licentious 
passions of unprincipled men ! and yet many 
of these men are so absurd as to pretend to 
sensibility : nay, so much is their conduct 
at war with their professions, that I have 

has indaced many to doubt in the possibility of these hor- 
rid rites having ever been practised ia India; but the 
proofs that are given in many of the Shanscrit writings, of 
human sacriBces oflfered, in remote ages, to this tmly 
infernal deity, seem too strong to be refuted.

hetrd them declaim, with apparent horrmiry 
against the holy ceremony of the Tirtaooi 
widow throwing hereelf upon the funeral 
pile of her deceased Lord. Tea, I have 
seen those, who coald witness the scene of 
misery exhibited in their own streets with^ 
oat betraying one symptom of oompas8ion> 
affect to shed tears of pity at the descriptloD 
of a Hindoo female's Tolantary sacrifice, 
by which she attained glory here, and had 
the certainty of happiness hereafter! Is it 
thos, by a pretended feeling for imaginary 
sorrows, that the Christian Shaster teaches 
men to exercne their benevolence ? Is it 
In conformity to any part of Us precepts, 
that they can so freely grleTc at eqniTocai 
and distant evils, while those which are be- 
fore their eyes excite neither compassion 
nor remorse ? 

However unfeeling others might be to 
the misery of the wretched females, one 
would think that the voice of nature in a 
fatber^s breast would cry aloud to save hia 
opring from a fate so dreadful ; but, deaf 



to her pleadings, parents themselveB do not 
hesitate to devote the unhappy Tictims, by 
meiHDs of an edocatioo wliich condacts them 
step by step Drom vanity to vice, reconciling 
themselves to all its direful consequences, 
by a repetition of the calmlistick word OEir- 
TBBi«, which has such a magical charm as 
to change, in their opinion, the very nature 
of every speciies of madness, vice and folly ! 
Caa a mind, pure and intelligent as that 
of Zaarmilla, delight to dwell with such a 
people? Is it from such a polluted stream 
that the descendant of a thousand Rajahs 
would wish to imbibe knowledge ? Foolish 
project! Perverted ambition! How many 
choice morsels of Shanscrit literature lie 
mouldering in the temples of Benares, which 
he may rescue from the ravages of devour- 
ing worms, and be repaid with the words of 
wisdom. Hath the shallow invention of 
Europeans conceived any work equal to 
the Mahhabarat? Can the aphorisms of 
their philosophers be compared with the 
Heetopades of Yeeshnoo Sarma? or the 



128 

imagination of their poets vie in lofty ima- 
gery, or sublime expreasion, with the beauti- 
fal dramas of the immortal Calldas 2 Doth 
the wbdom-loving Riyah delight to tread 
the maze of logick? Let him seekfdrgnh 
tification in the Persian writings of the Mua- 
•almans, which, though scarcely lawful for a 
Hindoo to peruse, are yet to be preferred to 
the absurd writings of Christian philoso- 
phers. 

Which of the lawyers of Europe baa shewn 
himself more expert in involving the simpli- 
city of truth in the deep mazes of perpiexi^, 
than the Imaom Aboo Yooseff, and ^ the 
more illustrious philosopher Ib'n EckesB al 
Shaffie ?* What king of Europe could ever 
boast of a Minister equal to that Golden 
Pillar who supported the throne of the re- 
nowned Ackbar ? Or who, in modern timea, 
can, among them, be compared with the 
Great Eradut Khan Waseh ? The memoirs, 
written by that Nobleman, is a gem of such

129 

transcendent worth and lustre, that its imita 
tion as far exceeds the abilities of the puny 
Nobles of Europe, as does the unshaken 
fidelity and magnanimous heroism of the il- 
KistriouB writer. In truth, there was no 
point in which I wait more disappointed, 
than in the state of learning in England. 
By multitudes of the people of that country, 
the name of Abul Fazel has never been 
heard! I conversed with many, to whom 
the renown of Veias was unknown, and can 
with truth aver, that numbers, who have the 
character of learned, are yet so very igno- 
rantj as not to know whether the great 
eity of Canouge was founded by a Hindoo or 
ft Mossulman ! 

With regard to the political state of 
Great Britain, its laws, and form of govern- 
ment, I am not qualified to speak with cer- 
tainty ; never having been able" to find 
any two people of the same opinion with 
respect to any of these points. One circum- 
stance atone appeared to be irrefragably 



130 

establuhed; and this is a circumstance so 
extraordinary that it deserves attention. 

Knowy then, that the Visier, or first 
Minister, to the king of Great Britain, is, at 
all times, the weakest and most wicked man 
in the kingdom, and that there is not a man 
in England, however incapable of managing 
with propriety the simplest concerns of pri- 
vate life, who is not much better qualified 
than the Minister to conduct the complex 
and extensive business of a great 'nation. 
You may, perhaps, be inclined to doubt the 
truth of this assertion; but when I inform 
you, that I repeat it not from vague report, 
but from the reiterated and solemn assevera- 
tions of the people I have alluded to, the 
point will appear incontrovertibly establish- 
fid. 

I herewith send, for the gratification of 
your curiosity, a specimen of the painted 
idols of the Europeans, the examination of 
which has lately employed much of my 
tjime. A rich field of conjecture is already 
opened, to the culture of which I shall wil- 



131 

lingly devote some of the remaining yean 
of my existence. That the origin of the 
rites of these divinities may be traced to 
the favoured country of Brahma, will not 
admit of a doubt. The flower, which one 
of the Goddesses carries in her hand, bears 
such a striking resemblance to the Lotos, 
that, at fir3t sight, any impartial person 
most recognise the adored figure of the 
bounteous Ganga. If any one of the figures 
has any claim to European origin, it is that 
of Knave ; but who ever heard of a Kit^ of 
hearts in the history of any nation of Eu- 
rope ? In the course of a few years investi- 
gation, I do not despair to prove the real 
family of every one of these painted idols ; 
and in the prosecution of this laborious work, 
I shall not disdain to imitate the method 
pursued by the antiquarians of England, for 
* wise men will not disdain to learn, even 
from the counsel of fools.' I recommend 
thee to the protection of Yeeshnd, and the 
favour of all the inferiour Gods. 
What can I say more ? 



LETTER VI. 

Third Letter qf OU Bremin. 

Before the delivery of my letter into the 
hands of the Dauk,* I resolved to re-examine 
the counsellors of memory, lest any circnm- 
stance, that would have influence to enlight- 
en the mind of the noble Ri^ah, should, an* 
fortunately, have been omitted. It vvas a 
happy precaution ! By it I am enabled to 
add to the proofs I have already given of 
the Braminical origin of the English nation, 
one other proof, which establishes the opin- 
ion of the Pundit beyond the reach of human 
controversy. 

Let it be known then to the friend of 
Maandaara, that the performance of the ce-

rernxmy of the Purekah*' u known to tht 
Christian, and so much is the practice of its 
mysterious rites encouraged, that the most 
trifliog and insignificant disputes are fre* 
quentljr referred to its decision : as, for ex- 
ample, in speaking of the colour of the eyes 
of a dancii^-girl, pne man should say that 
they were black, and another aver them to 
be bhie, the common method of deciding 
the dispute (either between people of sh^le^ 
or snch as pant for admission into that hon- 
ourable Cast) is the performance of Pare- 
kafa. The method of performing this sub* 
lime ceremony, is not, it is true, exactly 
similar, in all respects, to that which is so 
piously observed in India. A little consid- 
eration on the genius of the people and 
their deficiency in religious knowledge, will, 
however, account for the difference. In 
England, I never heard that the performers 
of the Purekah took the precaution of pre- 
paring themselves for the award of fate, by

boand themseires by any oath before the

of the gods. All these preparatory duties 
are, by these trifling people, altogether omit- 
ted, and the ceremony itself, instead of being 
performed in the presence of the Magistrate 
 and the assembled iieople, is usually gone 
through under the immediate Inspection of 
only two wUnesses,* In the Purekah of the 
English, they neither thrust their hands into 
yesaels filled with l)oiling oil, nor do they 
say to the Balance,  thou, O Balance, art 
the mansion of truth, thou wast anciently 
contrived by Deities. If I am guilty, O, 
venerable as my own mother, sink me down;^ 
but if innocent, raise me aloft in air.' Nei-

seven blades of Dharba grass ; bnt by means 
of the diminative Jgnee Astors^ called Pis- 
tols, the two disputants attempt to convey 
little leaden bullets into one another's bow- 
els, or brains. In the opinion of some phi- 
losophers, a worthless fellow will continue 
to be as much a worthless fellow after the 
performance of the Purekah as before ; but 
In the opinions of the performers themselves, 
it has efficacy to change the nature of guilt, 
and to wash away the foulest spot of dis- 
honour.

I BOW with reverence to Ganesa, and sub- 
mit the ardent straggles of my soul to the 
decrees of friendship. The request of 
Maandaara I am unable to resist^ even when 
his arguments are too feeble to make any 
impression on my mind : though my reason 
is unconvinced, I am subdued by my tender- 
ness ; and should consider myself unworthy 
of the name of friend, could I persist in tear- 
ing myself from my country at the moment 
that Maandaara is about to be restored to 
its bosom. Yes, my friend t I have this 
moment received the delightful intelligence 
that the Firman, which restores thee to thy 



137 

Zimeendary, bath been issued ! Tbou may- 
est return in peace to the land of thy fathers! 
The Gods of Baandaresa shall be raised 
from their hiding places in the earth, to be 
placed upon the altars of his son : they shall 
see him perform the rites of hospitality, 
spread his feast for the poor, and afford shel- 
ter to the oppressed. The Daivers, who de* 
* light in beholding the reward of virtue, 
shall hover round your dwelling. Seraswa- 
tee shall bless your hours of study, and the 
bees of Cama, ilivested of their stings, shall 
pay you the tribute of pure and genuine 
sweetness. 

I have prepared Zaamarcanda for receiv- 
ing you as her husband. Her mind is too 
gentle to require ^the harsh restraint of au- 
thority : let me, therefore, conjure you to 
treat her with tenderness ; and you T^ill be 
repaid by that willing obedience, which is 
the ofifspring of affection in a docile and in- 
genuous mind. For my share, I declai^e to 
you, that while I accept, with pleasure, of 
your sister for mj wife, I, at the same time,.

in direct opposition to your adrlee* From 
me she shall receive every iadti^Bee. If 
she has any understanding, I will take plea- 
sure in improving it: nor shall I dread any 
consequence that can arise from doing so. 
The more I meditate, the mote am I con- 
vinced, that to tread firmly in the path of 
virtue, it is necessary that we should be sap- 
ported by the staff of knowledge. Ignoraaee 
is the mother of many follies* 

It is with grief that I behold a mind, great 
.aad noble as that of my friend, darkened 
by the clouds of pr^udice. Had you^ with 
me, paid homage to Seraswatee, the sonl- 
enlightening Goddess would have inspired 
you with ideas more worthy of yourself: you 
would not then have attributed a desire to 
enlarge the sphere of knowledge, and an 
ardent admiration of excellence, wherever 
found, to the inluence of magical spells or 
incantations.

slandii^,' who convinced aie» by the cuiti* 
rated stale of his own, how hi|;fa tlie minds 
of mortals might soari — tbe enlightened, Per- 
Cfi^taugbt me to observe, that the negative 
ignoranoe in which the mind is immersedi 
when excluded from commerce with the 
worldf is of a natnre far less obdurate than 
that which has been rivetted by Pride in the 
bosom of society. Such is the ignorance of 
Bheermaal. His mind was too much narrow- 
ed by its own prejudices to receive a fair 
impression from new images, The few 
ideas which had been put into it by his first 
teacher, had been received without examina- 
tion, but retained with the pertinacity of un- 
yielding pride* 

Can lie be a proper judge of the peculiar 
customs of remote nations, who measures 
every thing by the narrow standard of his 
•wn pngodkes? Can he who, instead of 



140 

making obsenrationi on the variety of hu- 
man character, pronounces sentence of cob- 
demnation on whatever he does not aDde^ 
atand; can he be qualified for communicating 
Information to others ? No. False and fool- 
ish will ever be the conclusions of presampto* 
oos ignorance ! 

Aht what a pattern might Sheermaal 
have found in the travellers and the travel- 
writers of Europe. How many of these does 
England alone, every year, pour from ber 
maternal bosom ? Happy for Sheermaal, if 
he had followed the laudable example of 
these sapient youths ; how deep would then 
have been his observations ! how important 
his discoveries ! 

I am unwilling to speak with disrespect 
of a Bramin ; I view the ignorance of this 
man with pity, and should only give to bis 
pr^udice the smile of contempt, but I cannot 
perceive his malice and his falsehood with- 
out feelings of abhorrence and indignation. 
Is it for a mind» base and ignoble as his, to 



141 

accuse tbe ingenuous and enlightened Percy 
of falsehood? 

O (hat Maandaara could have known that 
incomparable youth! That he could have 
listened to his instructions, while every 
word he uttered was like the vivid flash 
of lightening, illuminating the dark expanse 
of night. He would then have been con- 
vinced, that a mind like his was incapable 
of swerving from the rigid dictates of truth, 
and he would have united with me in repro- 
bating every attempt to calumniate his 
memory. Dear shall his memory be to 
Zaarmilla, while the blood of life flows through 
his veins, and whoever would shun my re- 
sentment must be carefiil how they suffer 
the shadow of disrespeet to pass over the 
name of my departed friend ! 



I SAVE just received the two concluding 
letters of that ignorant and deluded Bramin, 
who has instilled his base prejudices into the 



142 

mind of my friend. Sorely some malignant 
Dewtah must have blinded the eyes and 
fettered the anderstanding of this unhappy 
man* who could not, otherwise have been so 
grossly deceived. — What! duriog his ten 
years abode among Christians, never to have 
heard of, or seen, the Christian Shaster! 
that Shaster, the most abstruse and difificalt 
doctrines of which are so carefully inculcat- 
ed Into the tender minds of youth, that eve- 
ly boy who is sent to the University is so 
perfectly master of the subject as to be able 
io give his soienm assent to the unerring ex- 
planations of his Church ; that Shaster, of 
which the precepts of peace. Charity, Hu- 
mility, and universal Benevolence, form the 
basis of every law, and direct the prac- 
tice of every Christian court! That Shaster 
I have studied with the strictest attention, 
and do solemnly assure you, that the virtues 
I have enumerated are as strictly eiyoined 
to the Christians, as the performance of 
Poojah to the Hindoo, or the Fast of 
Ramosin to the Mussulman. The Mussul- 



14S 

man fasts, and the Hindoo performs Poojabt 
according to their respective laws ; and can 
we believe that the Christian alone treats 
with contempt the authority of his God ? 

How could the lie-loving Bramin expect 
to be credited, when he asserts that Chris- 
tians enter into the traffick of blood t That 
these men, who walk by the rule of * doing 
to others as they would be done by in the 
like case,' invade the countries of the de- 
fenceless, and seizing, with tiger-like feroci- 
ty, their unoffending children, bind them in 
the galling chains of slavery, and devote 
them, as a cruel sacrifice, to the black god- 
dess of affliction ! Surely such a representa-. 
tion cannot fail to appear in its true light to 
every one who knows the jealousy entertain- 
ed by the sublime Governours of that enlight- 
ened nation for the purity of their honour ! so 
great, that even those Chiefs whom we have 
considered as bulwarks raised by the immortal 
Veesbnii to protect us from the destroyer, 
have fallen short of the standard of perfec- 
tion erected in the immaculate bosoms of 



144 

their brethren at home ! Can such men be 
•appoBed to sanction the traffick of human 
misery ? Ah ! how little doth he Isnow of 
the nndeviating rectitude of the Britisb 
Senate ! 

Indeed, all that he says upon the religioQi 
rites practised by the English nation is equal- 
ly false and absurd. There is no such thing 
as any Poojah performed to bits of painted 
paper; neither are partridges held sacred. 
From examining their Shaster, ¥rith the 
strictest accuracy, I am prepared to assert, 
that it contains not one word which could 
countenance such idolatry* And whether it 
is likely that any practices, not warranted by 
its authority, would be suffered to become 
prevalent, I shall leave you to judge ; after 
informing you, that, in England, no man ii 
deemed qualified for holding even the mean- 
est employment in the state, but by the per- 
formance of an act of the most solemn de- 
votion; an act which is only safe to the 
pious and the pure, and of which to partici- 
pate unworthily is declared tO be a heinous 



145 

iin ! Ah t how pure must be the morals of 
such a people ! 

As to what he says of the frivolous educa- 
tion bestowed upon Christian women, it ii 
sufficient to observe, that it is utterly incon- 
sistent with the belief of the immortality and 
progressive improvement of the human soul ; 
it is, indeed, to absurd to stand in need of 
confutation. When he can convince nie, 
that the men are vain, voluptuous, selfish^ 
and unjust, then shall I believe, that the 
women are frivolous and ignorant. 

In regard to what he asserts of the different 
Casts into which the people are divided, I 
am not so well prepared to answer him. I 
only know, that nothing like it appears in 
the Christian Sbaster. The people of family 
and the people of no family are there put upon 
a level ; and at the time it was written it is 
evident the people of style had never been 
heard of. 

Oh ! that it had been permitted me to have 
confuted the misrepresentations of this wick- 
ed Bramin by the unerring answers of expery

LETTER VIII. 

Prom the Rajah Z^^rmilla, to MWidiare. 
{Written from BarelUe.) 

^Mat the powerful Eendra be ever propiti- 
ous to the most benignant of friends, and the 
Goddess Sree preserve his heart from the 
arrows of affliction ! 

An opportunity offers, of which I am not 
•low to avail myself, of sending thee infor^ 
mation of my health and safety. Had not 
Borrow spread its raven wing over the beau- 
ties of every prospect, my journey might 
have been delightful. But, alas! to him 
whose heart is oppressed by recent calamity, 
the face of nature is veiled in darkness. My 
person was soon at a distance from the scene 
of sorrow, but from it I could not, by dis- 
tance, disengage my muid. Piymavedal 



152 

my affectionate and faithfal Prymaveda, 
expiring in my arms, was the picture that 
every where presented itself to my eyes. 
Her last low and and feeble sighs were still 
the only sounds which vibrated upon my ears. 
Change of scene afforded no alleviation to 
my griefs and Time, whose tongue of fire 
devoureth all things, appeareth to move 
with too slow a pace to leave me room to 
hope much from his assistance. One only 
souree of consolation presented itself to my 
deeply wounded mind, it was the reflection 
of having contributed to the happiness of 
her whose image dwells in my heart. Had 
I ever reproved with harshness, or indulged 
my pride in the morose exercise of authority, 
how insupportable would be the bitterness 
of my affliction ? 

Let not Maandaara reproach his friend for 
indulging in these melancholy reflections. 
The woman who is attached to her husband 
will follow the spirit of her departed Lord, 
even though condemned to the regions of 
punishment; and shall my soul forget her 



U3 

who waiteth for me in the reahns of death ? 
She, from whom sprang my final deliverer !* 
She^ who was the companion of my days, 
the friend of my heart, whose gentle man- 
iiefs and prudent conosels smoothed the rag- 
ged path of life and gave valae to every 
blessing. Bat, alas ! the innocent vivacity, 
the endearing tenderness, which, bat yester- 
day, were the delight of my life, are now re- 
called bat to aggravate my sorrow. But 
why should I with the dart that rankles in 
my own bosom wound -the breast of my 
friend ? Let me try to change the subject.

aiisfortane to die childless. In the drama of SacoDtala, 
Bashmanta thus lameots his fate, * Ah me ! the departed 
toals of my aocestors, who claim a share in the funeral

154 

At BiMoolee, I was received by my kins* 
man with every mark of kifidnesB. He en- 
deavoured to divert my mind from the sob^ 
ject of its own griefs, by taming my attention 
to those great transactions of which this 
country had lately been the scene. 

The first information tliat is given us upon 
any subject, that is in its nature intetoting, 
and which is beyond the reach of our own 
inspection^ is so greedly received, that the 
judgment we form upon it is equally prompt 
and decisive. I have frequently observed 
that such hasty judgment is upon more full 
investigation found erroneous; and here I 
had ample proof of the justice of the obser- 
vation. 

When the fall of the Afghan Cawns had 
taken place, we rejoiced to hear that this 
beautiful and fertile province was to be put 
under the administration of Bdftss BJkye* 
that pious Hindoo who had shed so many 
tears over the misfortunes of his country.

We ima^ned that he who eould paint the 
extortions and oppressions of the Afghans in 
such trqe and lively colours, must necessarily 
be possessed of a good and feeling heart 
Alas ! the art of describing human misery 
and the virtue of feeling for it are two very 
different things. 

This man, who declaimed so eloquently 
against the rapacity of the Afghans, had a 
heart so sieeled by avarice as to be. imper- 
vious to every sentiment of humanity. The 
country groaned beneath his oppressions, 
and his removal was considered as a deliver- 
ance from the pestilence. 

After having spent a week at Bissoolee, I 
took leave of my kind but too officious kins- 
man, and proceeded to Barellee. The ap- 
proach to this city, through lofty rows of 
bamboos, which form a continued arbour, 
sarrounded on every side by gardens flour- 
ishing in all the pride of beauty, extorted 
my admiration. 

I did not fail to visit the tomb of the re- 
noDvned Afghan, who was so long the terrour, 



15S 

and tbe glory of Kattaher.* I chose to visit 
it alone. There are mpmentB when the soul, 
absorbed in its own reflections, feels an 
elevation which is incompatible with any 
society. 

The sun had just hidden the splendour of his 
beams behind the hills of Bi8Soolee,and night 
begun to spread her dusky curtain over the 
face of nature, when I approached the silent 
scene where the tomb of the warriour was 
reared. Of that ambition, before the impetu- 
ous career of which the bars of gratitude and

the limits ? Small was tbe spot which con- 
tained tbe mouldering remains of him who bad

I listened — ^but the thunder of bis voice was 
no longer to be beard. I looked — but the 
crowds of flatterers, who were wont to pay 
adulatory homage to his smiles, were no long- 
er to be seen. The world, which had beheld 
the Afghan greatness arise like a meteor from 
the womb of obscurity, which had been dazz- 
led by the brightness of its splendour and as- 
tonished by the celerity of its progress, be- 
held, without regret, its utter extinction in 
this narrow tomb. I indulged in these reveries 
the greater part of the night. The remain- 
der of my time at Barrellee was spent in mak- 
ing inquiries concerning the remarkable 
events which have taken place in its vicini- 
ty. The difficulty of obtaining information 
was greater than I was aware of. Every 
one whom I applied to for that purpose, I 
found to be so brimful of tbat part of tbe

story which particularly related to himself, 
that I was obliged to listen to a volume of 
unioterestiog anecdotes before I could arrive 
at the truth. 

The ravages committed by the troops of 
his Highness, after the battle of Gutterah,* 
were such as have been constantly practised 
by every victorious army ; but the contrast 
exhibited in the behaviour of the English 
was altogether new and uncommon, such as 
DO Mussulman army has ever been known to 
practise ; and such as, I greatly fear, they 
will never be induced to imitate. 

After having, by their courage and superi- 
our skill, decided the event of the day, while 
those for whom they fought rushed upon the 
spoil of the defeated enemy, and, in their 
avidity for plunder, were alike regardless of 
the remonstrances of justice and the dictates 
of humanity, the gallant army of the English* 
satisfied ^ith the glory of victory, disdained 
all other spoil. They beheld, with indig*

allies, and exerted themselves for the protec- 
tion and relief of the unhappy sufferers, whom 
the successful foe had left destitute of every 
other resource. 

' All that I have heard in this place re- 
kindles in my bosom the desire so long 
cherished, and so unwillingly suppressed, of 
becoming more intimately acquainted with a 
people who had ever been the objects of my 
affectionate veneration. My resolution is 
taken ; and, in pursuance of it, as soon as I 
have performed the act of pious ablution in 
the sacred spot where the two wandering 
blessings of Hindostan unite their waves, I 
shall proceed to the English camp. In list- 
ening to the instructive conversation of these 
enlightened men, the selfish jorrows which 
at present occupy my heart may, for a time, 
be soothed into forgetful ness. I shall, per- 
haps, renew my acquaintance with the 
friends of Percy. I shall, with them, have 
the pleasure of recapitulating the virtues of 
that amiable youth : those virtues whose fra-

the subject of this letter, by consulting Mr. Maurice's In-

friends, Zaarmilla sends health and prosperi- 
ty. While the divine influence of the sa- 
cred stream into which I have so lately plung- 
ed, continues to refresh my soul, I hasten to 
impart to thee the sentiments which have 
inspired my heart But how shail I describe 
to you the transport with which 1 beheld the 
sacred spot, celebrated through all ages ! that 
•pot, consecrated by the threefold junction 
of the sacred Ganges, the health-giving Jum* 
na, and the unseen, but not less benignant^ 
Serraswattee ! I contemplated, with elevat- 
ed rapture, the junction of those honoured 
streams, which, here mingling their sacred 
waves, diffuse the exhaustless treasures of 
fertility and verdure over the most favoured 
of regions. From these blessed emblems of 
the mystick union of the divinities, my soul, 
wrapt in gratitude, ascended to the Almighty 
Creating Power, the grandeur of whose works 
u only to be equalled by his beneficence* 

In the lessons of the venerable Pundit, 
who was our first instructor, and in the sub- 



163 

lime writings of the great lamkiariea of the 
world, we have been taught to lift our hearts 
tOiHim, who alone is infinite in power and 
goodness ! But, alas ! the minds of all the 
BraminsI have met with here, are com- 
pletely engrossed by the multiplied symbols 
of his attributes. From their company I 
have received no pleasure, from their con- 
versation I have reaped no instruction. I 
shall, therefore, hasten the period of ray de- 
parture, and, probably, finish this letter from 
Benares. 



From the Queen of science, the favoured 
seat of learning, the celebrated Benares, 
Zaarmilla again addresses his fricftad. 

Before I say any thing of a place of which 
you have already heard so much, I shall pro- 
ceed to inform you of my visit to the English 
officers, in the garrison of Ghunar 



As I Btopt to take some refreshmeot, at 
the distance of a few cobs from the fort, I 
was informed, by my people, that some 
English officers, who had been out on a 
hunting: party, were, at that very time, in 
the same village. I sent to inform them of 
my intention of visiting Chunar; and, in 
a few minutes, I was no less delighted, 
than surprised, to see Doctor Denbeigh 
enter the veranda, where I was then repos- 
ing myself. He saluted me with that glow 
of kindness which is excited in the bosoms 
of the benevolent, 'by an unexpected inter- 
view with those whom the hand of time 
seemed to have separated for ever. He 
introduced me to his companions, the ur- 
banity of whose manners formed a striking 
contrast to the plainness of their dress. 

On my arrival at Chunar, I found myself 
as if I had been all at once transported into 
a new world. Surrounded by the JBnglish 
Chiefs, whose dress, whose language, and 
whose manners, were all so different from 
'what I had ever lieen accustomed to, I 



165 

eoDid searcely pereuade myself that I did 
not i^ander in the realms of delusion. 

At first, all Englishmen appeared t6 me 
to wear the same aspect and to have the 
same manners. But vrhen wonder had 
suflBciently subsided to admit of the calm 
accuracy of observation, I perceived that 
every countenance had a characteristiek dis- 
tinction, a distinction which extended to 
the tones of the voice and gestures of the 
body* This variety, like the Rginls which 
preside over musick,* served hut to render 
liarmony more pleasing. The senior Offi- 
cers smiled at the playful vivacity of their 
youthful friends, who frequently ventured to 
exert their wit in a manner that could not 
have failed to excite resentment in less 
amiable minds. The time of each was 
spent according to his own t^ste. By some 
it was employed in the pursuit of literature ; 

* The Rfiginfs, or female passions, are the Nympbf , 
which, according to the beautiful Allegory of the Hindoos, 
preside over musical sounds. A translation of some of 
the many Dissertations upon this sufigect which are to be 
found io the Shanscrit language, is much to be wished for. 



166 

and I am certain it must exalt roj new friends 
in the estimation of Maandaara, when lie is 
informed, that to the knowledge of the Per- 
sian, many of the English Chiefs add a con- 
liderable degree of information in the Sban- 
Bcrit language. The time of vacation from 
immediate service, wasted by the Mussul- 
man Commanders in voluptuous indolence, 
is spent by these more enlightened men in 
studies which add to their stock of, know- 
ledge and do honour to the genius of their 
country. It is by these strangers that the 
annals of Hindostan, which her barbarian 
conquerors have sought to obliterate in the 
blood of her children, shall be restored! 
Already have Temples, Palaces and Cities, 
which Calli^ had covered with the mantle 
of oblivion, been, by the indefatigable re- 
searches of these favourites of Serraswattee,

had once spread their golden fronts to the 
sun, proud of being the residence of the 
ancient Rajahs of our nation, now bow 
their time-worn heads to listen to the voice 
of strangers, and behold the sacred charac- 
ters, inscribed upon their bosoms, familiarly 
perused by a people, whose nation had not 
sprung into existence at the time these 
towering monuments of Eastern splendour 
had commenced the progress of decay 1 

I found great difficulty in tearing myself 
from the society of these gentlemen, from 
whom I experienced every mark of kind- 
ness and attention : the pain of parting was, 
however, in some degree alleviated by the 
promise made to me, by two of these Saibs, 
to rejoin me at Benares. 

I embarked, for the first time, on the 
mighty Ganges, and, turning my eyes to 
take leave of the seat of hospitality, I was 
struck with the appearance of the citadel, 
which seems to have arisen from the bed of 
Ganga ; the piety of our fathers is still legi- 
ble on the walls of this massy pile ; nor has 



168 

the guardian Dewtah forsaken her sacred 
charge. The seat of her residence remains 
entire. And though the refreshing breeze 
of morn nvafts her to the seat of Science^ 
she fails not to return to Chunar before the 
sultry heats of noon.* 

We gently floated down the unruffled 
bosom of the Queen of Rivers, which ex- 
pands itself on approaching Benares, and 
puts on an additional air of grandeur, in 
honour, it would seem, of this celebrated 
city. The city appears to have returned 
the compliment, and to have selected its 
choicest ornaments to deck the banks of 
its beneScent visitor. Numerous and beau- 
tiful are the Pagodas, all enriched by the 
piety and adorned by the ingenuity of our

quity. Id the citadel is a black marble slab, oo which

o*clock in the morning, when he is supposed to be at

Hindoos, attacks may l»e made upon the fort with a pros- 
pect of success. See Hodges' Travels ia India, page 56«

ancestors, which see themselves reflected in 
the mighty stream. Some, in mouldering 
ruins, tell of the injuries they have sustain- 
ed, not only from the insidious hand of 
Time, but from the ruthless bigotry of the 
destroying foe. innumerable Ghauts,* some 
of which are highly decorated, and embank- 
ments, which exhibit all the splendour and 
elegance of architecture, give additional 
grace and beauty to this most enchanting 
scene. 

My reception from the Rajah was ex- 
tremely flattering. You will, no doubt, be 
anxious for my opinion of this man, who 
BOW fills so exalted a station. 

There is no trial so dangerous to virtue 
as prosperity ; had the father of this young

Tou may imagine in what manner this 
*young man is imposed upon by his people, 
when I tell you, that they have actually 
made him believe that the present Gove^

mote their country's glory and the happiness

Kfi imagine, that from the base motives of per*

'^^ I was much rejoiced at the arrival of my 

two English friends, whose chief motive 
ri^ for visiting Benares at this time was to in- 
.. spect and examine the astronomical appara- 

tus still extant in the Tower of the Stars. 
!^ Both these gentlemen were deeply learned 
in this divine science. The stupendous 
engines, constructed by the ingenuity of 
our ancestors, for measuring the expanse of 
heaven, and tracing through its trackless 
arch the path of its illustrious inhabitants, 
filled their minds with astonishment, Alas 1 
that these evidences of the wisdom of our 
fathers should now serve to mark the dege* 
neracy of their children! That science,

which exalts the loul to heaven, jrhieh ena* 
bles it to peruse that book of wisdom where 
the Sopreme hath written his attributes in 
the most legible characters, even in the 
golden orbs, whose distant glories delight 
the eye of ignorance^^tbat science, so fa* 
miliar to oar fathers, is now almost lost to 
their nnenlightened sons. Bat as the splen- 
did laminary of the sky, when apparently 
extinguished in darkness, continues still to 
pursue his oonrse, illuminating with his 
brightness the various inhabitants of the 
earth ; so doth the Goddess of Science pur- 
sue her radiant journey : and when we vain- 
ly imagine she is goi|e for ever, if we open 
the eyes of our understanding, we shall* see 
her lieaming with redoubled lustre on the 
children of another hemisphere. These 
strangers eould, at one glance, comprehend 
the use of those Instruments, which the 
Pandits, who attended us, could not explain ; 
and I soon found that the knowledge impart- 
ed to us upon this subject, by our reverend 
teacher, was but ignorance, compared to 



ITS 

their superiour attaioments. Need we farther 
proof that the spirit of Brahma is not confin- 
ed to any particular region, but extendeth 
over his great creation ? 

In the conviction of this truth, I have 
determined to devote some months to the 
cultivation of a more intimate acquaintance 
with those who are so well qualified to im- 
part the light of knowledge to my mind. 

I have now fulfilled the purpose of my 
journey to Benares, but have no pleasure 
in the thoughts of returning to Almora. 
Alas ! wherefore should I return ? The lamp 
of love is extinguished in my dwelling, 
and darkness rests upon ray pleasant bowers. 
To my friend, and to my sister, I can, with 
confidence, entrust the only treasure that 
interests my heart. Yes, Zamarcanda, I 
k^ow that thou wilt watch with a mother's 
care over the helpless infancy of my child. 
May the Gods of our nation reward thy ten* 
derness !

LETTER X. 



From tke Samb» to the Samb» 



Whose happinesB, saith the wise iostractor, 
* is equal to that of the man who hath a 
friend to live with, a friend to converse with, 
and a friend to embrace V and sach happiness 
it is now my destiny to enjof. Behold me 
at Calcutta, under the same roof with the 
gentle Saib, who was the choice friend of 
the ever-lamented Percy ! 

Once more embarking on the bosom of 
the beneficent Oanga, I was conducted by 
the gentle Goddess to Patna, where the 
first person that met my arrival was no other 
than Captain Grey himself. He instantly 
recognised me, and received me with the 
spontaneous glow of cordial affection. The 



few days that I remained there, vrere chiefly 
occupied in yiewing that ancient city, which 
the residence of the English has recalled to 
the vigour of life. Nothing has more forci* 
bly struck my mind, in the whole dourse of 
my journey, than the amazing contrast, in 
point of fertility and cultivation, between 
the territories of the Christian and Mussul- 
man Lords of Hindostan. In the Mussul- 
man districts, we behold ruined villages, 
where, instead of the cheerful noise of the 
mechanick or the mingled hum of light- 
hearted Ioi|uac]ty, universal silence reigns; 
nor, in some once populous districts, does 
any human figure meet the eye, save that of 
some solitary Bramin, who, absorbed in con- 
templation, forsakes the haunts of men. 

The chief stations of the English, on the 
contrary, may easily be traced by the flour- 
ishing state of the country which surrounds 
them : there the peasant throws the grain 
into the liberal bosom of the earth with 
cheerfulness, assured that he shall reap the 
reward of his toil. Having paid his rent.

be knows that the remainder will be his 
own ; nor fears that it will be wrested from 
him bj the open violence of the spoiler, or 
seized by the hard hand of rapacious ava- 
rice. Even when the heavens withheld 
their fructifying distillations from the thirsty 
earth, and ghastly famine stalked through 
the provinces around, the benignant charity 
of the English Chiefs sustained the lives of 
thousands : and thousands more would have 
been saved from perishing, had their reli- 
gious principles permitted them to accept 
the proffered bounty.* 

The day after my arrival at Patna, Cap- 
tain Grey received the agreeable news of 
his having been promoted, by the Governor 
general, to a new appointment, which de- 
manded his immediate attendance at Cal. 
cutta. It was with pleasure that I accepted

coant of the a^jah, as being veiy different from that tale 
of horrors which has been so geoeraUy received. Which 
account comes nearest to the truth, those who have been 
tye witnesses of the scene described can best determine. 



his obliging invitation to accompany him 
thither. Several of his friends agreed to 
be of the partj. We proceeded in Budge- 
rows, furnished with every accommodation 
that could add pleasure to this delightful 
voyage. 

As the channel of the river enlarged, my 
heart bounded within me at the expanse of 
waters which surrounded me. * Yet what 
is this stream, in all its majesty,' exclaimed 
I, *\n comparison of that mighty ocean! 
that fathomless abyss ! which all these Eu- 
ropeans have already passed.' Such is the 
degree of knowledge to be acquired in re- 
tirement, compared to the attainments of 
those whose bosoms receive the waters of 
wisdom flowing through the thousand chan- 
nels of experience ! 

The novelty of the picturesque and beau- 
tiful scenery that frequently presented itself 
to oar eyes, produced astonishment and de- 
light ; but the uncommon traits of character 
which I olMerved in some of my companions, 
exhibited a novelty still more interesting. 



As an example, I shall only attempt to de- 
scribe to 70a a few of those features in the 
character of one young Officer, from which 
you may form some idea of the many sub- 
jects of wonder with which a stranger is sur- 
rounded when he enters into the society of 
Christians. 

The first thing that attracted my atten- 
tion toward this young man, was the beauty 
of his countenance; but the prepossession 
was soon done away by the familiarity of 
his manners, and that indecorous want of 
respect toward his superiours, which gave 
me inconceivable disgust. When the senior 
Chiefs opened their lips to speak, instead 
of listening in mute attention to the words 
of wisdom which proceeded from their 
mouths, he interrupted their discourse with 
some sally of wit, which not unfreqnently 
presented all they had said in so ridiculous 
a point of view as to excite the laughter of 
all present. Judge how this shocked and 
offended me ! Not a day passed in which he 
did not perform fome wild pranks ; in these. 



179 

bowever, there was such a mixture of pleas- 
antly as to force mirth to get the better of 
anger. On expressing to Captain Grey my 
surprise at the lenity with which this young 
man was treated, even by those who suffered 
from him, he gave me to understand that 
the follies of which I complained, were oc-^ 
casioned by a disease, called, in their lan- 
guage, HIGH spiRTTS ; a malady peculiar to 
the climates of Europe. This information 
quickly changed my aversion for the poor 
youth into compassion ; but, surely, if this 
disease be very common in those climates, 
it must be extremely troublesome: how 
happy is it, that it is not infectious ? I was 
very sorry to learn that he intended being 
of our party to Calcutta, and avoided, as 
much as possible, having any communica- 
tion with him ; but my efforts were vain : 
his disorder made him so restless, that he 
never remained in one part of the Budgerow 
for ten minutes at one time. 

It would be endless to repeat all the 
fooleries of this youth during our voyage; 



180 

I shall only mention th* following, yihich 
ivill be sufficient to give yon an idea of the 
effects of high spirits. 

It was on an evening of unparalleled beau- 
ty. The air, which had just lieen refreshed 
by a North-wester,*" breathed sweet fragrance; 
' delightful as the reconciliation of friends, 
when the clouds of resentment have been 
dissipated by the Sun of Truth. The clear 
blue sky saw itself reflected on the unruffled 
bosom of the Queen of Rivers. On the 
right hand, the lovely Goddess stretehed her 
majestick waves to such a distance, that the 
prominent and lofty banks, which formed 
her western girdle, appeared to our view as 
a black line touching the horizon. At less 
than half a coss distance on the left, a richly 
cultivated country smiled upon us, through 
the various openings of a Mango grove, 
which frequently intruded upon the verdant 
slope, to kiss the tresses of Ganga. 

• A term used io India for a particular species of hur- 
ricaoe. 



181 

We were tempted by the beautj of the 
evening to go oa shore somewhat sooner 
than usual: on our laodiog, innumerahle 
flocks of peacocks, lorjs, and other inha- 
bitants of the grove, were in motion, who, 
waviiig their resplendent plumage in the 
golden rays of the declining sun, gave an 
additional charm to the graces of this lovely 
landscape.*

the Third) in portraying the horrid deeds of our couotry- 
roen in India, and the calamitous state to which that 
couDtry was reduced, tlirough their oppressions, thus ex- 
presses himself : * Striking, indeed, is the contrast between 
the situation of the country at this* period, and that which

plumes to the sun.' c.

A ivalk to the next village was proposed, 
and agreed to by all the party, excepting

casions, to make the study of his own ease 
the principal object of his concern, and

objects, their confutation would have been an easy task.

the secret workings of the human mind, and pui?ues the

presume to say, that * though acquitted at the highest 
human tribunal, he could not acquit himself, or hope for 
acquittal at that far mart awful tribunal at rohick he dread*

To him young Cooper attached himself, de- 
clariog that he could not think of leaving 
alone, in a strange country, so valuable a 
gentleman. Pleased at this instance of his 
benevolence, vre commended his good-nature, 
and proceeded on our walk. 

Foliovring the course of the transparent 
Nullah,"' on whose banks we had landed, 
we soon arrived at a small village, most of 
whose peaceful inhabitants we found busied 
at their looms, heneath the friendly shade of 
a far spreading banyan. In one of the hun- 
dred arbours formed by the descending bran- 
ches, sat a musician, who softly touchq^the 
chords of a veena : to the sweet sound of 
"which the women and children were listening 
with mute attention. 

Our approach presented a new object to 
their curiosity. The musick had ceased, 
but was lenewed at the request of Captain 
Grey who entreated we might give no in- 
terruption either to their labours or amuse* 
ment. 

* Small streams. 



184 

Mean time the Chief of the village drew 
near, to perform the daties of hospitality. 
A young officer, who saw him advancing, 
hastily inqaired, in English, whether we 
could l>e supplied with milk from the vil- 
lage ? ' Archa Sahib, tamorrow Molluk,'* re- 
plied the villager, making a profound rever- 
ence. * To-morrow wont do for ns, friend,' 
replied the Officer, * we can't stay here all 
night.' And returning to Captain €hrey, 
*we have had a fruitless errand,' said be» 
* for the old man here, says, we can have 
no milk tiH to-morrow.' 

^Ijj^ poor fellow, who had been greatly 
mortied by the abrupt manner in which 
the gentleman had reeeived his offered ci- 
vilities, now repeated them to Captain Grey 
in the same terms^ who laughed very hear- 
tily at his friend for suffering the casual re- 
semblance between the sound of an English 
and a Bengal word to lead him into such a 
mistake. 

* Is not this your country ?— command in it what you 
pleaie! 



185 

Having received from the village an am- 
ple supply of the articles we wanted, we 
returned in search of our friends, followed 
by a train of villagers, loaded with milk*, 
eggs, fruit,  

We soon reached the Mango grove; but 
what was our surprise, on entering it, to see 
the poor fat gentleman straining his unwieldy 
limbs to grasp the trunk of a large tree, 
which he was attempting to climb as fast as 
his untoward bulk would permit. Panting 
for breath, he cast a look of despair on 
young Cooper, who sat perching on a bough 
of the same tree above; and whose v^e 
we heard from a considerable distance, ve- 
hemently urging his corpulent companion 
to^iroceed:  but two or three feet farther, 
my dear sir, and you will be out of all 
danger,' cried he. The poor gentleman 
made an effort, but slipped back to the same 
situation. * One other attempt, for heaven's 
sake, my dear sir,' resumed Cooper, * or the 
tyger will lay hold of your poor limbs.' 
* Gracious heaven !' cried the gentleman, io

ftgooy. At these ivords, be cast a ^anee 
around, which was folly descriptive «f the 
horroun of bis situation. On perceiviiig 
us, he shouted out, that Cooper had seen 
a tjger : beseeching us, at the same time, 
to assist him, and to take care of oorselves. 
Captain Orey, who immediately apprehend- 
ed some trick of young Cooper, inquired 
of the villagers, whether any tyger had 
been lately seen in the neighbourhood ? and, 
being answered in the negative, be prevail- 
ed on the poor gentleman to descend. On 
fbrther investigation, it appeared that the 
yoang gentleman had been seised with a 
paroxysm of his disease in our absence, and 
that the story of the tyger had been in- 
vented by him, in order to throw his poor 
unsuspecting companion into the awkwiud 
situation in which we found him; and of 
which he produced, next morning, so admi- 
rable a drawing, as excited a lai^bter in 
all who saw it : from me, I confess, it ex* 
torted an qnwilling smile. But these Eu- 
ropeans do not seem to think the enter- 



isr 

tainment Hiat Is parchased at the expense 
of the feelings of another b too dearly paid 
for. 

We arrived at Calcutta in the night, 
and went directly to the house of a friend 
of Captain Grey's, where, according to the 
rules of hospitality established in this place, 
we were both invited to take up ourabode. 
The Governour General is now in the 
country, and as it is not proper that I 
should appear till after I have been intro- 
duced to him, I shall have nothing of any 
consequence to write for some days. 



ir has always been my intention to com- 
municate to you a faithful copy of the first 
impression made upon my mind by every 
Dew object presented to it ; but knowing the 
Bpitude of ignorance to fall into the path of 
error, I am not without apprehensions, that, 
while I intend to inform, I may possibly 



188 

mislead. Thu shall not, however^ deter me 
from pursuing my plan, but only render me 
more careful in forming my judgment 

Experience has already taught me, that 
the conclusions which are formed with pre- 
cipitance, are almost always retracted with 
shame : thus, for instance, when I hear these 
Christians introducing, in familiar conversa- 
tion, the name of their Almghty Creator 
upon the most trifling occasions, nay, some- 
times, as it would appear, merely to supply 
the lack of matter and to fill the chasms of 
conversation, I can scarcely forbear from 
accusing fhtPA of impiety. But a moment's 
reflection convinces me of the absurdity of 
supposing that they, who boast the light and 
privileges of a divine revelation, can be guil- 
ty of irreverence to the Supreme ! I there- 
fore conclude, that when these Christians 
pronounce, with so much ease, tJuU Name^ 
which is held by every pious Hindoo in too 
great reverence to be uttered except upon 
the gravest and most solemn occasions, and 
which no faithful Mussulman was ever 



189 

known to pronounce, witfaoat a pause, it is 
from a eonsctousness of their own superiour 
piety, which they, doi^tless, imagine enti- 
tles them to this d^ree of familiarity with 
their Maker. 

Another instance of the same kind has oc- 
curred to me, in an expression much in use, 
the meaning of which» on applying to the 
Dictionary, I found to be that of the eternal 
pumshment cfthe S4nd in hell! I shuddered 
to think how often I had heard this dreadful 
doom pronounced by some of my fellow-tra- 
vellers, not only on their own souls, but on 
that of many of their brethren ! but on more 
maturely considering the matter, I found it 
more agreeable to the precepts of their re- 
ligion, as well as to the dictates of common 
sense, to conclude, that in my imperfect 
knowledge of the language, the negaiive had 
escaped me : and thus, what sounded in my 
ears as the most dreadful imprecation, was, 
in reality, an ejaculation uttered in the spirit 
of that charity, which teaches to pray for 
their enemies even in the moment of wrath. 



190 

Looking upon it in this proper light, I could 
not but admire the fervour with which I last 
night heard many petitions of this kind pre- 
ferred for the soul of a General Officer, who 
had introduced certain regulations into the 
service by which these gentlemen considered 
themselves a^rieved. And I make no 
doubt, that had the ^aculations of these 
young men been reported to him, he would 
have had the charity to pray for them with 
similar fervency ! 



^ A GREAT man,' saith he whose words 
are incomparable in wisdom, ' should speak 
kindly, without meanness; he should be 
valiant, without boasting; he should be 
generous, shedding his bounty into the dish 
of the worthy; he Should be resolute, but 
not rash.' This is the character of a great 
man!^ And such an one have I this day 
seen. 

* See Hetopadei. 



191 

It would be vain to attempt describing 
to yoa my feelings, wbile I stood in tbe pre- 
sence of this truly exalted personage. Of 
him, who uniting the lofty spirit of the re- 
nowned Acbar,* with the penetrating and 
comprehensive genius of his still more re- 
nowned minister, has shewn himself supe- 
riour to both in schemes of sound and exten- 
sive policy, as well as in that pure and 
blessed spirit of humanity which has distin- 
guished every act of his administration. 

The pious Hindoo, no longer forced to 
submit to laws that are repugnant to the spi- 
rit of his faith, no longer judged by the un- 
hallowed ordinances of strangers, beholds 
with extatick gratitude, the holy Shasterf 
rising, at the command of this enlightened 

* The Emperor Acbar was the cotemporary of our 
Queen Elizabeth, and is one of the few monarchs on whose 
character posterity can dwell with feelings of respect and 
admiration. The choice of such a minister as the great 
Abual Fazel, is a sufficient proof of his penetration. Kin- 
dred soals naturally discover each other.

GoveQiour, to be once more the standard of 
bis obedience. 

The same benevolence which has re- 
stored to our nation the invaluable privi- 
lege of being tried by our own laws, hae 
projected the extension of the same favour 
to the Mahomedan inhabitants of Hindos- 
tan. A translation of the Hedaya,'*'' both 
into the Persian and English languages, I 
am well assured, is about to take place, 
and thus the haughty Mussulman will re- 
ceive, from Christian magnanimity, a de- 
gree of favour and protection, which. the 
laws of bis Prophet never taught him to 
bestow! Surely, one such act is worth a 
thousand of those deeds of heroes, whose 
fame is written in letters of blood upon 
the fields of desolatioir! just as it is said, 
that 'truth being weighed against a thou- 
sand AshmavedajugSy was found to be of 
more consequence than the thousand offer-

At the house of the Governour General, 
I was introduced, by Captain Grey, to seve- 
ral gentlemen, both in the civil and rnili* 
tary departments. They were all extreme- 
ly kind and obliging to me, and appeared 
to be no strangers to those laws of hospi- 
tality of which our nation has long consider- 
ed itself as the ex^^usive possessor. 

I was invited by the Governour General 
himself, to a notch, or, as they express it, 
a baU, which was to be given in the even- 
ing, in a house appropriated to that pur- 
pose. On inquiry, I found that tbe dan- 
cers were to be all English ; a circum- 
stance that delighted me, as I have hitherto 
bad no opportunity of seeing any of their 
females. 

I waited with impatience for the hour 
which was to take us to the place appoint- 
ed : but as neither Captain Grey, nor any 
of his friends, had the same degree of curio- 
sity, the greater part of the company were 
assembled before we reached the room. 
, When we entered it, amazement and delight 

VOL. I. 17 



194 

took possessioQ of my soul. It is impossi- 
ble to convey to you, by words, any id^ of 
the beautiful objects that surrounded me : 
but you may judge of the transcendant 
power of their charms, when I tell you, that 
they shone forth with invincible lustre, in 
spite of the deformity of a dress, which ap- 
pears to have been invented by envy with 
an intention of disfiguring the fairest works 
of nature. These lovely creatures, to the 
number of about one hundred, were seated 
on benches in the European fashion, and 
smiled and talked to llie gentlemen who ad- 
dressed them, with great spirit and viva- 
city : but this I did not wonder at ; as I had 
been told by Grey, that they all either 
were or had been Dmicers : and, you know, 
women of that profession are seldom at a 
loss for conversation. 

The great man having entered, and re- 
ceived the compliments of the company 
after the manner of his nation, which con- 
sists of very little ceremony, the dancing 
commenced. But judge of my astonish- 



I9J 

ment, vvhen J beheld the dancing girls led 
out — ^not by their masters — but — debasing 
meanness! each by an English Chief! 
Sincere as mj respect for the Governour 
General certainly is, I could not restrain 
my indignation at seeing Chiefs, aiid mill* 
tary Commanders of high rank and autho- 
rity, thus pubiickly degrading themselves 
by dancing for his amusement. How in- 
consistent, thought I, is the conduct of 
mortals ! These men, ivho plume them- 
selves upon their notions of liberty and 
independence, submit, vrithout reluctance, 
to an indignity, to which the Omrahs of 
the empire, who, in the days of its great- 
ness, surrounded the royal Musmud and 
prostrated themselves to salute the dust 
which was shaken from the feet of royalty, 
would sooner have died than have submit- 
ted! Though, on the part of the English 
C-iefs, it appeared entirely voluntary, yet I 
thought I could perceive that many of them 
felt sufficient repugnance to (his degrad- 
ing business, which they went through with 



196 

that Bort of heroifk apathy and indifference, 
which you haye beheld in a criminal of 
our nation when about to be hanged. In- 
deed, I neyer saw a dance so very little 
amusing. The gestures of the women wei^e 
as little graceful as their dress ; and had it 
not been for the extreme beauty of their 
countenances, I confess I should soon have 
been tired with looking at them. 

A gentleman whom 1 had seen in the 
morning, told me, that his wife wished to 
be introduced to me. The request sur- 
prised me ; but as I knew the gentleman to 
be a personage of high rank and character, 
I prepared to follow him. He conducted 
me to the opposite side of the room, and led 
me up to a group of Bibbys, whom I had 
mistaken for superannuated dancing girls, 
but whom I now, to my infinite astonish- 
ment, discovered to be the wives of* men of 
rank and eminence, whose names according 
to the custom of their country, they bore. 
I could not find myself in the presence of 
these ladies without experiencing a consi- 



197 

derable degree of embarrassmeDt ; this ivas 
by no means the case with them ; like other 
females, they all spoke at once, and seemed 
endowed with much loquacity. They 
looked at me with steady countenances, 
totally void of that modest timidity, which 
is the most inestimable gem in female beau- 
ty. That glare of colouring, which* at first 
sight, caught my soul in the net of astonish-

Lost in these reflectioos, I liecame insen-

Tbe green borses of Surraya had seen me

from this nocturnal festival.

CalCDtta presents to the eye of a stranger, 
a spectacle, delightful from its novelty and 
amusing from the variety of its scenes. 
This city, nvhich so short a time since as 
the Sobahship of Gossim Ally Cawn, con- 
sisted of nothing more than a mean fort 
and a few surrounding huts, now sees rows 
of magnificent palaces, adorned by all the 
beauties of architecture, stretching along 
the banks of this favoured Mouth of the 
Ganges, to the distance of several miles. 
The extent and grandeur of the fortress, 
bave never failed to impress the Asiatick 
beholder with sentiments of awe and ad- 
miration; but all the descriptions we have 
received tended rather to give an idea of 
its strength than beauty : it is pre-eminent 
in both: and when the eye surveys even 
but a part of this grand and massy struc- 
ture, taking in, at the same glance, a view 
of the elegant buildings of the town, sepa- 
rated from. each other by gardens, rich in 
vegetable beauty, the silver current of the 
river, as it is partially seen gliding be- 



200 

tween the ships of every coloar, shape, aad 
natiooi vhich here nvave their various 
streamers on its bosom; it is impossible 
for imagiaation to conceive a sight more 
charming. Ad4 to this, the variety to be 
seen in the streets, where you behold a 
concourse of petople, whose dress, complex- 
ion, religion, and manners, all differ widely 
from each other: and whose nombers are 
so nearly equalled, that it is impossible 
to say who is the stranger. All appear 
to be at home. Here the holy Fakeer, 
with no other dress than a piece of muslin 
wrapped round his lean and shrivelled 
limbs, walks with folded arms, ruminating 
on some passage of the holy Shaster, and 
striving, by penance and mortifibation, to 
facilitate the moment of absorption and 
unchanging bliss. There the turbaned 
Mussulman, from the top of an adjoining 
minaret, adjures the foljowers of Mahomet 
to attend the hours of devotion in the holy 
Mosque; while the stately Armenian, the 
money changing Jew, and the no less money

loving EogHshman, mingle on the beach, too 
intent on their affairs of traffick to listen to 
any voice save that which calls to the tem- 
ple of Lacshmi.* 

European chariots, various in their form 
and elegant in their structure, dv^^n by 
horses decked in silver studded harness, glide 
like meteors along the streets ; passing, in 
their carreer, th^ country hackery ,t the heavy 
loaded camel, and even the miyestick, but 
unwieldy elephant, who turning up his great 
proboscis, wonders at the noise and bustle 
which surrounds him.

eonpftnied Captain Grey into the country, 
in an open Tehiele, called a Buggy, drawn 
by one bone, which he himself drove. It 
was the first opportunity we had for conver- 
aatkm since the GoYenoor's notch) and he 
was anxioos to know my opinion of it. 

* What do you think of the ladies,' cried he ; 

* did you not think some of them very beau- 
tiful f I answered, * that as to beauty, I 
moBt confess, I thought the ladies had but a 
slender share in every respect, bloom only 
excepted, compared to that which adorned 
the dancing giris ; they, indeed, were beau- 
tiful T *'Tis them I mean,' returned he; 

* you do not think I could expect you to ad- 
mire the old painted witches, to whom 

introduced you ?' * I could never have 
thought of giving the appellation of ladies to 
dancing girls,' returned I, gravely. ' Hanc- 
ing girls !' repeated he, bursting into a fit of 
laughter, * Why the ladies whom you saw 
dance, were, many of them, married ladies, 
of rank and distinction; the lovely Mrs. 
"^ * *, and her still more lovely sister, tvere of 



203 

the namber.' * Is it possible,' cried I, * that 
men of rank can basely contaminate their 
honour, by suffering their iivives and daugh- 
ten to stoop to the degrading employment of 
dancers to the G. G— '. * why,' returned 
Grey, almost suffocated with laughter, * do 
you imagine they danced to please him?' 
*• Whom should you all dance to please, but 
him T rejoined I, peevishly, a little picqued 
by the excess of his mirth. * Forgive me, 
dear Zaarmilla,' returned my companion ; ' I 
confess nothing could be more natural than 
your mistake : I certainlj^i ought to have in- 
formed you, that dancing is a favourite 
amusement in Europe ; it forms part of the 
education of both sexes, and to dance grace- 
fully, is an accomplishment on which women 
are taught to set a very high value : nor is it 
without reason that it is thus esteemed, for 
nothing sets off the charms of a fine. woman 
to greater advantage. * Did you not remark 
the young lady in the blue and silver?' con- 
tinaed he. ' The elegance of her figure, the 
gracefulness of all her motions, the animation 



204 

that sparkled in her eye, and the sensibility 
that glowed in her countenance. Never did 
— ^ but here a sudden stop was put to the ha- 
rangue : in the vehemence of bis description, 
mj friend had neglected the management of 
the reins ; the wheels of the carriage were 
intercepted by the stump of a decayed tree, 
and the horse impatient of the interruption, 
began to fret, and rear, till the love-pierced 
charioteer, applying his whip to the unfortu- 
nate animal, forced him to make a sudden 
spring, which at once extricated him from 
confinement, and broke the carriage to pieces. 
W« were both thrown to a considerable dls^ 
tance, and though neither of us received any- 
material injury, we were sufficiently bruised 
to make us remember the lady in the blue and 
silver for some days to come. 



It is upon those subjects which particular- 
ty excite my curiosity, that I find it mo9t 



205 

difficult to procure information. Captain 
Grey, who is always willing to oblige me* 
when I call upon him for instruction, is 
naturally of so silent a disposition, that I 
fear to trouble him by a multiplicity of ques- 
tions. When, happily, he of his own accord 
engages in conversation, he appears to pos- 
sess a mind enriched by the ore of knowl- 
edge, adorned by the gem of taste, enlighten- 
ed by the steady torch of intellect. 

The war, in which his nation is at present 
engaged, is a subject he seems particularly 
assiduous to avoid : for, alas ! my friend, it 
most be confessed to thee, that these Chris- 
tians do not always, as I have hitherto sup- 
posed, carry arms anli^ to redress the wrongs 
of the injured, to assert the cause of the 
oppressed, or to defend themselves from the 
invaders of their country; — they actually 
make war upon one another ! 

I have, in vain, sought in their Shaster for 
some precept that might give a sanction to 
this custom, for some incident, in the life of 
their great Teacher, that might afford a 

VOL. I. 18 



206 

precedent for boman batcheiy. But, no. 
Whether I torn to the life and oonyenation 
of the Founder, or to the precepts and exam- 
ple of his fint followers, I 6nd bot one spirit 
— the spirit of peace, of love, the meekness 
of charitj, and the magnanimity of forgive- 
ness. How then comes War 7 that scourge 
of mankind! nurse of guilt! and parent of 
desolation ! How comes it to be practised 
by the professors of a religion, which pro- 
claimed ' peace on earth, and good-will to- 
ward the children of men T I confess that 
this question has greatly puzsled me ; and 1 
can solve it in no other way, than by soppos* 
ing, that the Christian Shaster, presented me 
by Percy, is nnl camfltU : and that an addi- 
tional revelation hath, in after times, been 
aflbrded to these Christians : in which supple- 
ment to the Gospels, it is ordained, that 
when a sufficient number of Christian men 
are united together to form an army, a brig' 
ade, or any other nulitary division, and are 
dressed in a particular colour, blue, or scarlet 
or a mixture of both, they shall be licensed 



207 

to commit murder, at the command, and by 
authority, of their religious superiours (provi- 
ded they are in the regular receipt of pay for 
so doing); and that all the slaughter, blood- 
shed, and devastation, so committed upon 
their Christian brethren (for whose salvation 
they believe a Saviour to have descended 
from above, and in whose society they hope 
to live for ever in the Kingdom of Heaven) 
shall no longer be termed Murder, but 
Glory !

tioii. It if true, I meet with manj thingB 
that woold greatly shock me, did I not con- 
sider, tliat that variety of manners, as well 
as of sentiments, which is pleasing to the 
soperioar divinities, ought not to be displeas- 
ing to ns. 1 nevertheless cannot be eanlj 
reconciled to that costom of devooring the 
flesh of to many innocent and nnoffending 
animals, whose lives are daily sacrificed in 
Older to procure a sliort-lived, and inel^ant 
eiyoymentto the vitiated palates of these 
Toloptnaries. The iigustice done to these 
animals, is, however, amply revenged, by the 
* qualities of the liquors which it is the custom 
to swallow at the conclusion of these cruel 
feasts ; and which, when taken in great quan- 
tities, seldom fails to pervert the senses, and 
reduce the reason to a temporaiy level with 
the victims of their gluttony. 

In regard to the ceremonies of the Chris- 
tian religion, of which you want to be in- 
formed, I am sorry I cannot satisfy your 
curiosity. Were I unacquainted with the 
peculiar precepts of their Shaster, I should 



209 

be surprised at the little appearance of devo- 
tioir that is to be observed among them ; but 
knowing that it is expressljr commanded 
them to ' pray in secret/ and not appear un- 
to men to fast, my wonder is changed into 
admiration at the strictness and punctuality 
with which they adhere to the precept! The 
same secrecy is, indeed, enjoined them with 
regard to their acts of charity, but it must be 
confessed that, in this particular, they are 
not quite so scrupulous. 

I yesterday accompanied Captain Grey to 
a hall, called a coffee-house, where it is the 
custom for gentlemen to meet and converse 
on business^ or politicks. We no sooner en- 
tered, than I observed the eyes of my com- 
panion to fix upon a young man of about 
seventeen or eighteen years, who sat in a 
comer of the room, apparently retiring from 
observation. Melancholy and dejection 
were painted on a countenance, which the 
hand of nature had endowed with manly 
beauty. The meanness of his attire pro- 

VOL. I. 18 * 



210 

claimed him to be no favourite oTLackahmi,* 
but bis air seemed suited to a better garb* 
Captain Grey took up a printed paper, 
which lay before him, but his eyes were fre- 
quently turned toward the youth, and his 
mind appeared absorbed in reflection. A 
person, at length, entered, wlio addressed the 
young man by the name of Morton. * Mor- 
ton!' repeated Grey, springing toward the 
youth, his eyes glistening with pleasure and 
his manly countenance animated by the 
glow which warmed his bosom, 'Morton,' 
repeated he, *was the name of my first 
friend, my worthy tutor , and every feature 
tells me that you, sir, must be his son.' 

'The Reverend Mr. Morton, of •, 

was my father,' returned the young man.' 
' Then you are the son of my old friend,' 
cried Grey, taking the young man by the 
hand ; and you must look on me as a brother : 
but this is no place,' continued he, ' to have 
all my questions answered; you must come

211 

home with me, and let me hear every par- 
ticular respecting the situation of your fami- 
ly, and especially that of your worthy father, 
who, I hope, is yet alive ?' « Alas t No ;* 
returned Morton: 'it pleased Heaven to 
take him from us upward of ten months ago/ 
The tear of filial sensibility, which trembled 
in the eye of Morton, appeared to be infec- 
tious; my friend Grey seemed afraid of it; 
and taking the young man by the arm, he 
instantly led him to the house that is now 
our home. 

On our arrival there, he engaged the 
young man to give him a recital of all that 
had befallen his family, since the period in 
which he had been under the tuition of his 
father. The relation was short and simple. 

His father, who it seems was a priest of 
the order of Curates (for so, at my request, 
he wrote the word) had, in his old age, 
been assailed by disease, and afflicted by 
poverty : death, at length, came to his re- 
lease, and sent him to obtain the reward of 
virtue in the region of felicity. 



The youog man, after this event, proposed 
to visit India; hoping, that in a region, 
which since the foundation of the world has 
been pouring out her treasures to enrieh the 
various countries of the earth, he might ac- 
quire a competence for the support of his 
mother and sisters. With the reluctance of 
a fond parent, struggling between the dic- 
tates of prudence and the yearnings of affec- 
tion, his mother at length yielded to his en- 
treaty. She was the sooner induced to do 
so, from the consideration of the many afflu- 
ent relations she had in the capital ; all of 
whom, she fondly hoped, would strain every 
nerve to promote the interest of her son. 
To all these affluent relations she wrote in 
his behalf, requesting from them letters of in- 
troduction to some of the great Chiefs in In- 
dia, and having presented him with these 
harbingers of future fortune, she suffered 
him to depart, loaded with maternal blessings. 
On his arrival at the capital, which they 
call London^ he did not fail to visit those 



213 

relations on whom depended his prospects of 
fature felicity. 

Some of them having been under peculiar 
obligations to his father, would, he doubted 
not, rejoice in this opportunity of ducharging 
their debt of gratitude ; but it unfortunately 
happened, that he never could find ' any of 
them at home. 

After repeated disappointments, he wrote 
to each of them, enclosing his mother's let- 
ten to them ; and after many days of anx* 
ious solicitude, he received the answers of 
those on whom hu hopes had been principal- 
ly placed. They all grieved at not having 
it in their power to serve him : they could 
not but be sorry, extremely soriy, that he 
had set out in the most unlucky moment 
possible: for one had just procured an ap« 
pointment for the son of his tay lor, and could 
not again trouble his friends in power with 
a similar application. Another had lately 
made it a point never to solicit any thing 
for any person out of his own family. A third, 
had given up, some years ago, all correspon- 



214 

dence with India; and a fourth, had made a 
recent vow never to plague his friends with 
letters of introduction. Mortified and dis- 
pirited with these various disappointments, 
he was on the point of giving up the pursuit, 
when his landlady, who had formerly lived 
In his father's parish, informed him, that her 
daughter's husband had a friend, who was 
intimately acquainted with a butcher, who 
had a vote in a borough, of which one of 
the Directors of that company of Merchants 
who have become the Sovereigns of so great 
a part of India was the representative : by 
this train of interest she hoped to do some- 
thing for him. The good woman's hopes 
and honest endeavours were not frustrated^ 
Through the friend of her daughter's hus- 
band, she procured for him an introduction 
to the slayer of cattle, who prevailed with 
the Director to favour the Curate's son with 
a letter of introduction to one of the English 
Chiefs at this place ; and, at the same time, 
gave him an order for his passage in one of 
the Company's ships. 



2U 

His sufferiDgs on the voyage were many^ 
but bis ardour was iovincible Immediately 
on bis arrival at Calcutta, be presented the 
letter, on which was founded all his future 
hopes ; but, alas ! what was bis mortification, 
on being told, by the great man to whom it 
was addressed, that it was only one of a 
hundred applications of the same kind, the 
twentieth part of which it was utterly im- 
possible for him to attend to ! 

In a land of strangers, without friends and 
without bread, too modest to solicit, and too 
proud to bear the harshness of repulse with- 
out feeling its indignity, is it to be wondered 
that he was reduced to despondency ? 

It was at this period, in the moment of 
dejection and despair, that he was discover- 
ed by the worthy friend of Percy, in whom 
he has, indeed, found a brother. 

This incident seems to have entirely ba- 
nished that silence and reserve, which I 
have hitherto considered as natural to the 
temper of my friend. Roused by the ardour 
of friendship, he exerted, in its cause, all his 



216. 

eloquence and activity; and, in two days, 
procured for the young man an appointment, 
Tvbich will soon enable him to return the ob- 
ligations he owea to parental tenderness with 
the substantial proofs of filial affection. 



I HAVE for some days laboured under an 
indisposition, which has k«pt me from going 
abroad. The most mortifying circumstance 
attending my confinement, is the deprivation 
of the pleasure I promised mydelf, in accom- 
panying Grey to the houses of some noble 
Saibs, where numbers of Bibbys were as- 
sembled. By the accounts I received from 
bim, on his return from these parties, I could 
easity perceive that the remembrance of the 
bruises we received in our fall, had not been 
able to give him any antipathy to the lady 
in the blue and silver. As often as he was 
disappointed in his expectations of seeing 
her at any of those feasts, the disappoint- 



217 

ment was visible in his coantenance, and he 
cut short all inquiries, by declaring, that the 
Tisit had been very stupid. But if the even- 
ing wafs spent in her presence, hilarity smiled 
in every feature, afid joyfulness beamed from 
his eyelids. 

I longed to see a female, capable of 
making so deep an impression on a mind so 
solid ; and as soon as I was able to go abroad, 
I accepted, with eagerness, an invitation to 
the house of a friend, where she, and many 
other ladies, were expected to spend the 
evening. Captain Grey had, in his impa* 
tience, ordered our Pallenkeens at so early 
an hour that we were at his friend's house 
long before any other guest appeared. The 
ladies, at length, came; and I recognized 
the features of several whom I had seen at 
the notch; but methought they appeared 
more modest, as well as more beautiful, than 
when I mistook them for. dancing girls, so 
much is our opinion under the dominion of 
out imagination. I was now eager to listen 
to their discourse, and delighted in the ex- 

voi*. I. 19 



218 

pectatioh of hearing words of wisdom pro- 
ceediDg from the lips of beauty. Wise might 
be the words they uttered, and truly edifying 
their conversation ; but, unhappily for me, 
I was too ignorant of the topicks they dis- 
cussed to receive much benefit. 

Two ladies, who had just arrived from 
' England, engrossed the greatest share of the 
discourse: innumerable questions were put 
to them, which they answered with great 
quickness and volubility. In the course of 
their conversation, frequent mention was 
mhde of publick places ; by which I under- 
stand institutions similar to those formerly 
established at Athens, where the renowned 
Socrates, Plato, Zeno, -c. initiated their 
disciples in the mysteries of wisdom and 
philosophy : whatever are the sciences taught 
at those modern seminaries of taste and 
leamingi the minds of these ladies seemed 
to have acquired the most lively relish for 
them ; and the name of Vestris"' (who I take

210 

to be one of the principal of (heir instruc- 
tors) was never mentioned without the epi- 
thet of delightful ! charming! divine! 

It is not surprising, that to these females, 
so well instructed, so learned and sedate^ 
should be entrusted the most important con- 
cerns of the state. Such an one's having 
had an affair with a certain great man, was 
frequently mentioned : but so great was the 
modesty of these ladies, that not one of them 
ever hinted at having had an affaxr with any 
great man herself. 

While I was employed in listening to this 
conversation, my friend Grey was too much 
occupied with the young lad^i whose charms 
had captivated his heart, to pay attention to 
any other object. In conversing with her, 
he seemed inspired with unusual eloquence ; 
and I was happy to perceive that the fair 
maiden appeared not insensible to his atten- 
tion, but smiled upon him with angel-like 
sweetness and complacency. 

I have already observed to you, that no- 
thing can be more awkward and ungraceful 



220 

than the dress of these females ! their robes, 
iostead of falling in easy an'd graceful folds 
arouad their limbs, are extended on huge 
frames, made of bamboo, or some similar ma- 
terial, and give to their figure very much 
the shape of a Moor Punky.* The only 
useful ornament they have, is a Choury.t 
vrhich, instead of being carried in the hands 
of their attendants, is stuck in the heads of 
the ladies, where, by the continual motion, 
it is of great utility in driving off the flies, 
which are here much more troublesome and 
offensive than in Euttaher. 

After some time was spent in conversa- 
tion, many oC the company sat down to 
cards : that which Sheermaal ignoraqtly pro- 
nounced a species of worship ; being, in reali- 
ty, no other than an amusement invented by 
the Europeans* as chess was by our ances- 
tors, for the pastime of the rich and idle. 

* A country vessel of a peculiar coostnictioD, used for 
the coDve3^ace of cotton and other bulky articles, 
f K buDch of feathers used to drive away the flies. 



221 

Judge, then, what degree of credit is due to 
the representations of that arrogant Bramin, 
when he asserts, that many of the females of 
the West make this pastime the chief busi- 
ness of their existence, sacrificing to it the 
duties they owe to society, as wives, as mo- 
thers, as rational and intelligent creatures. 
Base slanderer ! how little doth he know of 
the ladies of England t 



I HAVE omitted no opportunity of pro- 
curing from the young friend, of Captain 
Grey, some degree of information respect- 
ing the order of the Priesthood, to which his 
father belonged. These Priests, when spo- 
ken of collectively, are called tiu Church; 
and have the precedence of the Sovereign, 
as may be inferred from the usual mode of 
expression, Church and King. 

From the conversation of Morton and his 
friend, I am convinced that to preserve the 



primitive pnrMy of their religion, is the first 
object of attention to the English Govern- 
ment To ascertain the virtues of those 
who are devoted to the sacred function, tbej 
are destined to undergo trials of no common 
kind. Worldly riches and honours are held 
out, not as rewards to virtue, but rather as 
means of proving the degree of pride, venali- 
ty, hypocrisy, meanness, -c. of the individ- 
uals; and as they are carefully withheld from 
all who have not given unequivocal proofs 
of some of thfse qualifications, men of mod- 
est virtue and rigid integrity run no risk of 
being spoiled by the pomps and vanities of 
this wicked world. 

By these humble and lowly men, are per- 
formed all the most sacred and imporiant 
duties of their function. These instruct the 
ignorant, comfort the afflicted, visit the sick. 
It is the prayers of these, which ascend to 
the throne of the Eternal ; and it is these 
likewise, who, from their slender store, im- 
part relief to the children of indigence. 



233 

Sucb were the duties performed by the 
father of Mr. Morton, who, according to 
Grey, added to the virtues of a Christian 
Priest the learning of a true philosopher. 
This excellent man was never molested by 
the offer of what is cMedprepmnent^ but was 
permitted to exert his superiour talents and 
virtues in a state of poverty, equal to that of 
the first teachers of Christianity. 

Thus is the purity of the Priesthood pre- 
served. The least worthy of its members are 
provided for in this world; and those whose 
labours have been truly beneficial to man- 
kind, who have diffused knowledge by their 
writings^ inspired the love of virtue by their 
precepts, and taught the practice of it by 
their example, are premitted to look for their 
reward in the world to come ! 



• In this world,' says the philosopher, « the 
wealthy are every one, every where, and at 



3S4 

all tioMs, powerfid. Riches being the fooo- 
dation of prefenneiity and an introduction to 
the favoar of the Prince.'* It is likewise, 
here, a necessaiy introduction to the, favoar 
of the ladies. 

M7 poor friend Grey returned this morn- 
ing from the hoose which is the residence of 
his charmer, in a state of indescribable agita- 
tion. Vexation, displeasure, and disappoint- 
ment, were written in such legible characters 
on his countenaoce, that tbejr could neither 
be concealed nor mistaken. I soon discover- 
ed that his uneasiness had arisen from that 
sex, whose fickleness and infidelity have 
been the theme of the satirists of a thousand 
generations. 

We are told by the sages, ' that women 
have been at all times inconstant, even 
among the celestials ; and that the security for 
their virtue is neither a precise behaviour, 
nor a modest countenance, but depends solely 

* See Hetopades. 



225 

on the want of suitors.^'" These are words 
of gall, flowing from the heart of the disap- 
pointed ! It was not, however, on the fick- 
leness of the sex that my friend poured forth 
the invectives of his wrath ; it was upon their 
avarice and ambition. 

Had I given credit te his assertions, I 
should have considered all the yoang Bibbies 
of Calcutta as votaries of Lackshmi;t and

ugly, none virtuous, valiant, or wise, but as 
he is rich* 

The smiles df the lady in the blue and 
silver, which gladdened the heart of my 
friend, were not bestowed upon him, but upon 
the fortune, which, by the mischievous folly 
of young Cooper, she was led to imagine he 
possessed. Charmed by her affability, and 
misled by the complacency with which she re- 
ceived his attentions, my friend assured him- 
self of having a place in her heart. His for-

tune is not large, but he imagined it suffi- 
cient to preclude every inconvenience ; and 
indulged himself in forming the most en^ 
ciianting picture of domestick felicity. He 
went out this morning with an intention jof 
imparting his scheme of happiness to her on 
whose approbation it was to depend. He 
was chagrined at hearing she was not at 
home : but was met at the gate, by the mas- 
ter of the house, who is brother-in-law to the 
lady, and who politely entreated him to re- 
turn. How great was his surprise, on enter- 
ing the apartment, to which he was led by 
the gentleman, to see the fair object of his 
passion seated beside a rich civilian, to whom 
fortune has made amends for the sparing 
boons of nature ; and on whom the young 
Bibby smiled with the sweetest compla- 
cency. Poor Grey^ stunned by this appear- 
ance, was yet more embarrassed by the dis- 
tant coldness with which she returned his 
salutations. He did not long remain in a 
situation so cruelly mortifying, but casting a 
look of contempt on his mistress, hastily 
withdrew. 



227 

He was met in the antichamber by young 
Cooper, who, reading in the countenance of. 
the rejected lover all that had passed, burst 
into a loud laugh. * So, she has discovered 
the trick,' cried he ; ' I could lay a hundred 
guineas, by the woeful length of your coun- 
tenance, that she as found us out.' Grey^ 
who was in no hurry to be trifled with) 
quickly put an end to his mirth, and forced 
from him an explanation of the circumstances 
to which he alluded. Cooper confessed to 
him, that the very evening on which the 
lady was first introduced to his acquaintance, 
he had mentioned him to her as the worthy 
possessor of manff lacks. 

Piqued at being thus made the dupe of the 
mischievous trick of a boy, and the scorn of 
an ambitious woman, he rails at the whole 
sex, without considering that disappoint- 
ment is, most frequently, the * fruit of the 
tree of our own planting.' He knew not the 
character of this damsel — but she was beau- 
tiful ; he assured himself it must be excel- 
lent ! He knew not from whom her mind 
had received the light of instruction — but she 



228 

danced gracePulIj ; and be gave her credit 
for everj- accompUsbment. She smiled upon 
him — ^and was it possible to doubt her dis- 
cernment ? The qualities which alone con- 
stitute the affectionate wife, the faithful 
friend, the tender mother, were the spontane- 
ous offspring of his own impassioned fancj. 
Bom of errour, how could thej be expected 
to live to maturity ? 

This affair has given me much pain, on 
account of the wound it has inflicted on the 
feelings of my friend ; and, for my own part, 
I grieve to find, that these lovely females 
of England are not totally free from imper- 
fection ! 

Having just had notice of an opportunitj 
of dispatching this packet, I hastily bring it 
to a conclusion. 

May the errours of others teach us wis- 
dom and while the waters of experience 
flow through our hearts, may they fructify 
and enrich the soil ! The blessing of thy 
father rest upon thee. 

What can I say more ? 



LETTER XL 

From the Same, to the Same. 

Since I last held tbe reed that is dedi- 
cated to friendship, my soul has been tossed 
in the whirlwind of conflicting passions. 
My desires have been at variance with 
each other. Friendship calls me to Al- 
mora, while the insatiable thirst of curio- 
sity, the love of knowledge and of novelty, 
all unite in prompting me to the hazardous 
undertaking of an European voyage. 

Full of dangers and of difficulties as 
this step may appear to you, no obstacle 
presents itself to my view half so formida- 
ble as thy disapprobation. But why should 
a difference of opinion between men of 
sound principles cause a breach of friend- 
ship ? « The stalk cfihe Lotus may be broken, 

voii* I. 21 



230 

and fh# fbre$ remain cmuuded:^ and are 
not the fibres of affection that unite 010* 
hearts of a still stronger textore ? 

Let not the length of the voyage, or the 
consideration of its dangers, give anj un- 
easiness to the breast of my friend; for 
* what is too great a load for those who 
have strength? What is distance, to the 
indefatigable? What is a foreign country, 
i^j those who have science? Who is a 
stranger to those who have the habit of 
speaking kindly ?'* 

Every thing I have seen, every thing I 
have heard, since I have been in this place, 
has tended to create donbt and aggravate 
curiosity. My opinion of the morals and 
manners of Christians, formed upon the 
precepts contained in their Shaster, has 
been frequently staggered by the observai* 
tion of practices inconsistent with its sim- 
plicity, and the knowledge of actions irre^ 
ppQcilable to the tenor of its precepts, 

* See UetopadeB, page 93. 



231 

It is true, these instances are not univer- 
sal ; and that by far the greater number of 
those with whom I converse are men who, 
though they have not the . words of (heir 
Shaster often in their mouths, seem to have 
imbibed a part of it^ spirit in their hearts. 
Indeed, the extreme delicacy observed by 
the Christians of this place, in regard to the 
expression of religious sentiment, is so uni- 
rersal, that I do not wonder, that to such a 
superficial observer as Sheermaal, it should 
have appeared doubtful whether they really 
had any religion at all. 

This amiable modesty, which no doubt, 
originates in that respect for the opinions of 
their Mussulman and Hindoo friends, which 
renders them anxious not to hurt their feel* 
iog by an opposition of sentiment, is carried 
to such a length, that they, who generously 
extol the wisdom of Zoroaster, the morality 
of the Koran, and the sublimity of the Veda, 
make no more mention of the energetick 
eloquence of Paul, or the beautiful simpli- 
city of the Gospels, than if they were actu* 
ally ignorant of both ! 



232 

But to return to the more immediate sub- 
ject of this letter. I have not determined 
on the important step I am about to taJte, 
without weighing well all the arguments 
which I thought yoo could adduce against it. 

The loss of Cast, which to yon appears 
so formidable, has, I confess, to me lost 
many of its terronrs. I have made it the 
endeavour of my life, to act in the manner 
that to me appeared most conformable to 
the will of the omniscient Spirit, the eter- 
nal Brahma, and * he^ saith Krishna,  he is 
my servaMy he is dear to use, who is free from 
enmity ; mere^ul ; and exempt from pride^ and 
s^ishness : who is the same in patn, and in 
pleasure ; patient of wrongs : contented^ and 
whose mind is fixed on me alone J** 

Can this Being, whose animating spirit 
is spread abroad over the whole universe ! 
can he behold with displeasure the attempt 
of any of hb creatures to explore the varied 
forms of being which partake of his essence ?

233 

Doth not this All-pervading, Life-giving 
soul of universal nature, reside in the pierc- 
ing regions of the nortii, as well as in those 
-which are favoured with the smiles of Sur- 
raya? And doth not the knowledge of his 
truth exalt the children of Brahma more 
than the descent of a thousand Avators ? 

Let then Maandaara rest assured, that in 
quitting, for a season, the favoured land of 
Hindostan, Zaarmilla doth nothing contrary 
to the spirit of our religion : and as for the 
censures of the bigotted and illiberal, I re- 
gard them not. ' He,' saith the Prince of 
Goverdhan, ' is my beloved, of whom man- 
kind is not afraid, and who is not afraid of 
mankind : who is unsolicitous about events, 
and to whom praise and blame are as one.'"^ 

But, in truth, from the Bramins I have lit- 
tle to apprehend. I have given orders, 
that the gifts I have so liberally bestowed 
may be continued; so that the accustomary 
Poojah may be regularly performed in my

VOL. I. 22 



234 

absence ; and I have sent them such reasons 
for my departure, as, I make no doubt, will 
perfectly satisfy them. 

It is thou Maandaara, it is thou, that art 
entrusted with the hope of Zaarmilla's heart. 
My son ! the tender pledge of the love of 
Prymaveda, 1 confide to thy care : my confi- 
dence is in thy virtue, and in the tender 
afifection of my sister. I was a father to 
her tender years, shall she not be a mother 
to those of my child ? 

May the Ruler of the Devas keep thee 
from evil! May Vreheshpatee watch over 
thy dwelling, and the boulitiful Lackshmi 
load thee with her blessings. 

What can I say more ?
